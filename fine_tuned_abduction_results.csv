What is the distinction between deductive inferences and inductive/abductive inferences?,"The distinction between deductive inferences and inductive/abductive inferences corresponds to the distinction between necessary and non-necessary inferences. In deductive inferences, what is inferred is necessarily true if the premises from which it is inferred are true; that is, the truth of the premises guarantees the truth of the conclusion. In contrast, in inductive and abductive inferences, the truth of the premises does not guarantee the truth of the conclusion.","The distinction between deductive inferences and inductive/abductive inferences is whether the conclusion follows directly from the premises, or whether the reasoning leads to an inference that also leads to the conclusion.

What is a simple procedure that can be used to ensure that the best explanation is not missed when generating a set of candidate explanations?,"A simple procedure that can be used to ensure that the best explanation is not missed when generating a set of candidate explanations is to define a new hypothesis as the negation of all the previous hypotheses, and add this new hypothesis as a further candidate explanation to the ones already considered.

This proposal is similar to the one made by Lipton (1993).","A simple procedure that can be used to ensure that the best explanation is not missed when generating a set of candidate explanations is to start with an empty set of explanations and add to it only the explanations that are also in the set of best explanations of the same type that was generated when the empty set of explanations was first considered.

This is not a problem of vicious circularity, but rather a problem with the argument's leading to an unacceptable conclusion","The problem with this argument is that it leads to a worst-everistic IWE, which is a type of IWE that is always false, but it is impossible to give a rigorous definition of a type of IWE that would make this argument true. This means that there is no way to ensure that the worst explanation of a fact ever given is the IWE.

What is the additional condition Psillos posits for a rule-circular argument to be valid?,The additional condition Psillos posits for a rule-circular argument to be valid is that one should not have reason to doubt the reliability of the rule—that there is nothing currently available which can make one distrust the rule.,"The additional condition Psillos posits for a rule-circular argument to be valid is that one should not have reason to doubt the reliability of the rule before one comes to the conclusion one is going to (Psillos 1999, 10).",0.9422738552093506,0.9348292946815491,0.9498379230499268
What is the purpose of philosophical argumentation according to Psillos?,"According to Psillos, the purpose of philosophical argumentation is not always to convince an opponent of one’s position, but sometimes to assure or reassure oneself that the position one endorses or is tempted to endorse is correct.",The purpose of philosophical argumentation is to convince one's opponent of one's position.,0.9191437363624573,0.9574570059776306,0.8837786912918091
How can the reliability of abduction be supported using enumerative induction?,"The reliability of abduction can be supported using enumerative induction by arguing that every newly recorded successful application of abduction, such as the discovery of Neptune, adds further support to the hypothesis that abduction is a reliable rule of inference, in the way in which every newly observed black raven adds some support to the hypothesis that all ravens are black.","The reliability of abduction can be supported using enumerative induction by arguing that the frequency of occurrence of hypotheses that are later shown to be true has been high, and that this has been the case for a number of years. This is because the frequency of occurrence of true hypotheses has been high, and because the frequency of occurrence of false hypotheses has been low, it follows that the number of true hypotheses that one can infer by abduction has been large.<|",0.8688439130783081,0.8634572625160217,0.8742981553077698
How can Bayesians determine their prior probabilities and likelihoods?,"According to Lipton, Bayesians ought to determine their prior probabilities and likelihoods on the basis of explanatory considerations.","A prior probability or likelihood can be determined in the following way: We start with a prior probability of 1 and add 1 to each of the following probabilities and likelihoods, until we have a probability of 1 and a likelihood of seeing exactly one observation:",0.8620389103889465,0.8526634573936462,0.8716226816177368
What is the issue with assigning priors in the context of Lipton’s recommendation to the Bayesian to be an explanationist?,"The issue is that any reason for fixing one’s priors counts as legitimate by Bayesian standards, and one assignment of priors is as good as another, provided both are coherent. So, it is not clear what one should do differently if one wants to follow the recommendation. Should one give the same prior to any best explanation that one’s neighbor gives, that is, lower one’s priors for best explanations? Or rather should one give even higher priors to best explanations than those one already gives?","The issue is that it is not clear what it means to assign a prior to a hypothesis that is a “best explanation” (or, more generally, to a hypothesis that is a “best explanation” in a given context), and it is not clear what one should do in order to be explanationist when one has such an assignment.",0.8729305863380432,0.8850970268249512,0.861094057559967
What is the idea of Lipton's proposal?,"The idea of Lipton's proposal is that, as long as one does assign highest priors to those hypotheses that are the best explanations, everything is fine, or at least finer than if one does not do so, regardless of one’s reasons for assigning those priors.","The idea is that, when we are given a list of true and false claims, we should assume that the list contains a lot of false claims and a few true ones, and then check whether any of the true claims is a repetition of a false claim. In other words, we should check whether the list satisfies a certain condition that we can assume about lists of this kind.",0.8397541046142578,0.8405708074569702,0.8389390707015991
What are some reasons that a hypothesis may be considered a better explanation than its rivals before any data are known?,"A hypothesis may be considered a better explanation than its rivals before any data are known because it requires less complicated mathematics, because it is stated in terms of familiar concepts only, or because of internal features of the hypothesis that can be evaluated without having to observe the world.","A hypothesis may be considered a better explanation than its rivals before any data are known because it is more plausible, because it is more consistent with the available evidence, or because it is more amenable to explanation. These reasons may be combined to justify the assumption that the hypothesis is the best explanation that we can have at that time.",0.9089276194572449,0.9085609316825867,0.909294605255127
What is the Principle of Indifference and what is its problem?,"The Principle of Indifference is a principle that, when there is no reason to favor one hypothesis over another, one should assign equal priors to competing hypotheses. The problem with this principle is that there are typically various ways to partition logical space that appear plausible given the problem at hand, and that not all of them lead to the same prior probability assignment, even assuming the Principle of Indifference. This makes the Principle of Indifference inconsistent and thus not a principle of rationality.","The Principle of Indifference is a rule that states that, in order to avoid making a mistake when deciding on an action that has a probability distribution, one should assume that the distribution that maximizes utility is the one that one would have followed if one had known what the next moment’s outcome was. The problem with this rule is that it is not clear what the probability distribution that one would have assumed is, and it is not even clear what the principle of indifference means.

How can explanatory considerations be used in Bayesian reasoning?,"Explanatory considerations can be used as a heuristic to determine priors and likelihoods in cases where we would otherwise be clueless and could do no better than guessing. This is because we are not always able to assign a prior to every hypothesis of interest, or to say how probable a given piece of evidence is conditional on a given hypothesis.",An explanation may be considered only if it is more probable that the counterfactual version of the hypothesis is true than it is that the alternative version is true.

What role does Psillos assign to abduction in his proposal to supplement Bayesian confirmation theory?,"Psillos assigns a role to abduction in his proposal to supplement Bayesian confirmation theory where abduction assists in selecting plausible candidates for testing, and the actual testing then follows Bayesian lines. However, he concedes that this proposal assigns a role to abduction that will strike committed explanationists as being too limited.","Psillos assigns a role to abduction in his proposal to supplement Bayesian confirmation theory by arguing that it is best to trust the most informative hypothesis that explains a given set of observations, provided that one also believes in the hypothesis that one has reasoned one's way to that explanation. This is because one can always make a more informative hypothesis that does not violate the observed data, but which one does not believe.<|im_end|",0.8610568046569824,0.8407755494117737,0.8823407888412476
What is a possible relationship between abduction and Bayesianism?,"A possible relationship between abduction and Bayesianism is that they operate in different modes of reasoning. Abduction could have its home in the epistemology of belief, and be called upon whenever we reason about our beliefs in a categorical mode, while at the same time Bayes’ rule could have its home in the epistemology of degrees of belief.","A possible relationship between abduction and Bayesianism is that they share the assumption that the best explanation is the one that is most likely to be true, but this is not true of the relationship between Bayes and abduction that is usually assumed to have been in play during the early history of the theory of inference. (See, for example, Bayes' Rule and the Theory of Inference, by J. J. C. Smart.)",0.8694478869438171,0.8687739372253418,0.8701227903366089
What is the difference between abduction and induction?,"Abduction is the process of forming a hypothesis to explain surprising observations, while induction is the process of inferring general laws from particular instances.","Abduction is the process of inferring a hypothesis or law from a subset of available explanations, while induction is the process of inferring a general law or rule from a sample of observations.

What is the problem of induction according to Charles Sanders Peirce?,"The problem of induction, according to Charles Sanders Peirce, is that we can never be sure that the conclusions we draw from our observations are true, because we can never observe everything. Instead, we must rely on abduction, or inference to the best explanation, to justify our hypotheses. This means that we must choose the simplest and most likely explanation for our observations, but we can never be completely certain that it is correct. This is a challenge for scientific realism, because it means that we can never know for sure whether our theories accurately reflect the world. Instead, we must always be open to the possibility that new evidence may require us to revise our theories. Skepticism, on the other hand, takes this uncertainty to an extreme, arguing that we can never know anything for certain. However, Peirce argues that this is not a reason to give up on the pursuit of knowledge, but rather a reason to be humble and open-minded in our quest for truth.","The problem of induction, according to Peirce, is that we cannot be sure that our hypotheses are true, and that what we observe is the same thing as the thing we most want to explain. This makes it difficult to formulate a coherent theory of science that accounts for our inductive practices.",0.887813150882721,0.9102493524551392,0.8664563298225403
