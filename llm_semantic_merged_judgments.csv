However, he also suggests that it is not impossible to formulate a coherent version of the rule, and that this version is not incompatible with the assumption that the rule is probabilistically coherent. Double-circular logic, on which the rule is based, is thus considered to be coherent.

What is the distinction between premise-circularity and rule-circularity?,"An argument is premise-circular if its conclusion is amongst its premises. A rule-circular argument, by contrast, is an argument of which the conclusion asserts something about an inferential rule that is used in the very same argument.","Premise-circularity and rule-circularity are two different types of circularity in logic. Premise-circularity refers to the circularity of a premise, which means that the conclusion follows from the premise. Rule-circularity refers to the circularity of a rule, which means that the rule follows from the premises. For example, the rule ""If a man is tall, he wears shoes"" is premise-circular because","The distinction between premise-circularity and rule-circularity is whether the rule is circular in its application. In the case of a rule, the rule is circular if and only if it is true that, for all premises Pi, you are guaranteed to make a conclusion Ci that is identical to the conclusion made in response to every other premise that you have, where Ci is the conclusion you are guaranteed to make when you make the conclusion Di, for all i such that for some j, you have a special relationship with j that is identical to that which you have with respect to Pi.

Here are some reasons why a hypothesis may be considered a better explanation than its rivals before any data are known:

2. It is more testable: A hypothesis is more testable than a rival hypothesis","A hypothesis may be considered a better explanation than its rivals before any data are known because it is more plausible, because it is more consistent with the known facts, or because it is more likely to be true.

What is the Principle of Indifference and what is its problem?,"The Principle of Indifference is a principle that, when there is no reason to favor one hypothesis over another, one should assign equal priors to competing hypotheses. The problem with this principle is that there are typically various ways to partition logical space that appear plausible given the problem at hand, and that not all of them lead to the same prior probability assignment, even assuming the Principle of Indifference. This makes the Principle of Indifference inconsistent and thus not a principle of rationality.","The Principle of Indifference is a philosophical principle that states that all objects have equal value and no object is more valuable than any other. However, this principle has a problem because it does not take into account the subjective value of different objects. The problem is that the principle does not consider the subjective opinions or preferences of individuals, which can lead to injustice and inequality.

What is the problem of induction according to Charles Sanders Peirce?,"The problem of induction, according to Charles Sanders Peirce, is that we can never be sure that the conclusions we draw from our observations are true, because we can never observe everything. Instead, we must rely on abduction, or inference to the best explanation, to justify our hypotheses. This means that we must choose the simplest and most likely explanation for our observations, but we can never be completely certain that it is correct. This is a challenge for scientific realism, because it means that we can never know for sure whether our theories accurately reflect the world. Instead, we must always be open to the possibility that new evidence may require us to revise our theories. Skepticism, on the other hand, takes this uncertainty to an extreme, arguing that we can never know anything for certain. However, Peirce argues that this is not a reason to give up on the pursuit of knowledge, but rather a reason to be humble and open-minded in our quest for truth.","According to Charles Sanders Peirce, the problem of induction is the difficulty of establishing a connection between a given fact and a general principle. This is because the process of induction relies on the assumption that the given fact is true, which is not always the case.","The problem of induction, according to Peirce, is that we cannot be sure that our hypotheses are true, and that what we observe is the same thing as the thing we most want to explain. This is because our experiences are not independent and objective, but rather are shaped by our social and historical context.

What is Abelard's metaphysics known for?,"Abelard’s metaphysics is known for being the first great example of nominalism in the Western tradition. He is an irrealist not only about universals, but also about propositions, events, times other than the present, natural kinds, relations, wholes, absolute space, hylomorphic composites, and the like. Instead, Abelard holds that the concrete individual, in all its richness and variety, is more than enough to populate the world. Abelard preferred reductive, atomist, and material explanations whenever possible; he devoted a great deal of effort to pouring cold water on the metaphysical excesses of his predecessors and contemporaries.","Abelard's metaphysics is known for its emphasis on the relationship between mind and matter, the idea that the world is made up of two distinct realms, the physical and the spiritual, and the importance of the human mind in understanding the nature of reality.",Abelard's metaphysics is known for its emphasis on the unity of being and its dependence on the theory of categories.,fine-tuned
What does Abelard argue about the nature of universals?,"Abelard argues that universals are nothing but words and that ontological realism about universals is incoherent. He holds that there cannot be any real object in the world satisfying Boethius’s criteria for the universal, namely something present as a whole in many at once so as to constitute their substance. Hence, Abelard concludes, universality is not an ontological feature of the world but a semantic feature of language.","Abelard argues that universals are not inherent properties of things, but rather are properties that exist in the mind of the thinker.

What does Abelard argue is the result of objecting to a piece of reasoning on the grounds that individuals are unique in virtue of their non-essential features?,"Abelard argues that this objection makes accidents prior to substance, which confuses things with their features.","Abelard argues that objecting to a piece of reasoning on the grounds that individuals are unique in virtue of their non-essential features means that individuals are not identical to one another, and therefore cannot be considered as a single, homogeneous entity. This is because individuals are not identical to one another in the sense that they possess the same essential characteristics, such as rationality, intelligence, and moral virtue.","Abelard argues that the result of objecting to a piece of reasoning on the grounds that individuals are unique in virtue of their non-essential features is to show that the piece of reasoning in question is false.

What is the consequence of identifying the universal with the individual according to Abelard?,"According to Abelard, the consequence of identifying the universal with the individual is that either individuals such as Socrates are common to many, or there are as many universals as there are individuals, each of which is absurd.","According to Abelard, identifying the universal with the individual is a mistake because it leads to a false sense of individuality and separateness. The universal is not a separate entity, but rather a fundamental aspect of all things, and the individual is a product of the universal. The individual is not a separate entity, but rather a reflection of the universal.","The consequence is that Abelard's identification of the universal with the individual is not a logical impossibility, but rather a logical impossibility.

What is Abelard's view on the universality of common nouns?,"Abelard holds that common nouns, such as 'animal', are semantically general in that their sense applies to more than one thing. However, they do not name some general thing. Instead, they distributively refer to each of the individuals to which the term applies. For example, the term 'animal' has the sense living substance, which is inherently general, and it refers to each individual animal since each is a living substance.","Abelard believed that common nouns are universal in the sense that they refer to a generic or abstract concept, such as ""dog,"" ""tree,"" or ""house,"" regardless of the specific object or situation they refer to. He argued that this universality is a fundamental property of language, and that it is not limited to any particular language or culture.","Abelard's view is that common nouns are universally used in all languages, although they may be used in different ways in different languages.

They are defined as the sum of all the terms in a series, where each term is a constant multiplied by a variable. For example, the integral of a function over a closed interval is the sum of the values of the function at each point in the interval.

What is the difference between a mereology and Abelard's theory of substantial integral wholes?,"A mereology is a general theory of the relations of part to whole, whereas Abelard's theory of substantial integral wholes is a specific type of mereology that holds that there are privileged divisions of wholes into their principal parts. Intuitively, some wholes have a natural division that takes precedence over others; a sentence, for example, is divided into words, syllables, and letters, in precisely that order. According to Abelard, the principal parts of a whole are those whose conjunction immediately results in the complete whole. His intent seems to be that the nature of the composition (if any) that defines the integral whole also spells out its principal parts. A house consists of floor, walls, and roof put together in the right way. It is an open question whether each principal part (such as the wall) requires the existence of all of its subparts (every brick). The principal parts of a collection, for example, are just each of the members of the collection, whatever may be the case with any given member’s subparts; the principal parts of an aggregation are the members located in proximity to one another.","Mereology is a branch of philosophy that deals with the properties and relationships of individual objects, while Abelard's theory of substantial integral wholes is a philosophical theory that proposes that all objects are made up of substantial wholes, which are the fundamental building blocks of reality. The main difference between the two is that mereology focuses on the properties and relationships of individual objects, while Abelard's theory of substantial integral wholes emphasizes the fundamental nature of objects","The difference is that Abelard's theory of substantial integral wholes is a theory of relations between whole objects, while a mereology is a theory of categories and the relations between them.",fine-tuned
What is the relationship between natural kinds and God's creation of the world?,"According to Abelard, the division of the world into natural kinds is a 'shallow fact' about the world, meaning that it could have been different had God ordained it differently. This suggests that natural kinds are not inherent in the world, but rather are a result of God's creation. Furthermore, Abelard suggests that if the causal powers of things were different, then natural kinds might be different as well, or might not have been as sharply differentiated as they are now. This reinforces the idea that natural kinds are a result of God's creation, rather than inherent in the world itself.","Natural kinds are categories of things that are similar in some way, such as animals, plants, and minerals. God created the world by creating natural kinds, which are the categories of things that exist in the world.

"What does Abelard mean by ""assertive force""?","Abelard uses the term ""assertive force"" to refer to the way in which a sentence expresses a proposition. For example, the sentence ""Socrates is in the house"" expresses the same proposition whether it is used as an assertion, a question, or a wish. Abelard argues that the propositional content of a sentence can be distinguished from its assertive force, which allows him to make certain distinctions in the way that sentences are used in logic. For instance, the component sentences in a conditional statement are not asserted, even though they have the same content that they would have if they were asserted. Similarly, Abelard defines negation and other propositional connectives purely in terms of their propositional content, so that negation is treated as a truth-functional operator that applies to the content of a sentence, rather than to its assertive force.","In the context of the text, ""assertive force"" refers to the ability to assert oneself or one's opinions without fear of being rejected or criticized. It is a key concept in Abelard's philosophy, which emphasizes the importance of standing up for one's beliefs and principles even in the face of opposition or criticism.",Abelard means that the assertion of a false premise is a force of reason that makes it more likely that the true conclusion follows.,fine-tuned
What does Abelard mean by 'entailment' in the context of his theory of argument?,"In Abelard's theory of argument, 'entailment' refers to a necessary and relevant connection between propositions, where the conclusion is required by the sense of the preceding statement(s) and cannot be otherwise. Abelard often speaks of the sense of the final statement being 'contained' in the sense of the preceding statement(s), and he considers an entailment to be complete when it holds in virtue of the logical form of the propositions involved, meaning that it holds under any uniform substitution in its terms. The traditional four figures and moods of the categorical syllogism and the doctrine of the hypothetical syllogism are all instances of complete entailments, or valid inferences, in Abelard's theory.","In the context of Abelard's theory of argument, entailment refers to the relationship between two propositions, where one proposition is necessarily true given the other proposition.

What is the concept of signification in Abelard's philosophy?,"In Abelard's philosophy, signification is the informational content of the concept that is associated with a term upon hearing it, in the normal course of events. Abelard treats signification as both a causal and a normative notion, where the word 'rabbit' ought to cause native speakers of English to have the concept of a rabbit upon hearing it. He insists that the signification is a matter of the informational content carried in the concept, and not mere psychological associations or mental images. Abelard believes that achieving clarity in our concepts is an arduous business, and requires an understanding of how understanding itself works. He also believes that the significations of some names, such as those corresponding to natural-kind terms, are abstractions that include only certain features of the things to which the term refers, and are capable of further determinate specification.","In Abelard's philosophy, the concept of signification refers to the idea that meaning is not inherent in objects but rather arises from the relationship between them.

What is the reason Abelard argues that sentences signify more than just the understandings of the constituent name and verb?,"Abelard argues that sentences signify more than just the understandings of the constituent name and verb because first, a sentence such as ‘Socrates runs’ deals with Socrates and with running, not with anyone’s understandings. Second, sentences like ‘If something is human, it is an animal’ are false if taken to be about understandings, for someone could entertain the concept human without entertaining the concept animal, and so the antecedent would obtain without the consequent. Third, understandings are evanescent particulars, mere mental tokenings of concepts. But at least some consequential sentences are necessary, and necessity can’t be grounded on things that are transitory, and so not on understandings. Sentences must therefore signify something else in addition to understandings, something that can do what mere understandings cannot, which Abelard describes as signifying what the sentence says, calling what is said by the sentence its dictum (plural dicta).","Abelard argues that sentences signify more than just the understandings of the constituent name and verb because they convey a meaning that is not just a representation of the constituent parts but also a representation of the relationship between the constituent parts. The sentence ""I love you"" is not just a representation of the love between two individuals, but it also conveys the relationship between the two individuals, which is the essence of love.","Abelard argues that sentences signify more than just the understandings of the constituent name and verb because they are also signs of what is called the hypothetical content of sentences, which is a reason to believe what is true of the world.

What is the standard way to reconcile the conformality theory and the resemblance theory of concepts?,"The standard way to reconcile the conformality theory and the resemblance theory of concepts is to take the mind’s possession of a concept to be its ability to transform itself through the inherence of a form, construing formal identity as natural likeness, where having a form in the mind that is identical to the form of the object understood just is to have a mental image of that very object.","To reconcile the conformality theory and the resemblance theory of concepts, one can consider the following steps:

1. Define the concepts: The first step is to define the concepts that are being studied. In the conformality theory, the concepts are defined as those that are similar to each other. In the resemblance theory, the concepts are defined as those that are similar to each other but not necessarily identical.

2. Identify the similarities: Once the concepts","The standard way to reconcile the conformality theory and the resemblance theory of concepts is to say that they are both true as long as there is a one-to-one correspondence between concepts and their corresponding objects, and to explain why this one-to-one correspondence is the best one-to-one correspondence that can be had without violating either the conformality or the resemblance theories.

What is Abelard's argument against conformality?,"Abelard argues that if forms inhere in the mind, then the mind should have physical properties, which is absurd. He concludes that conformality, the theory that the mind has the identical form as an external object, is incoherent.","Abelard's argument against conformality is that conformity is not necessarily a good thing. He argues that conformity can lead to a lack of individuality and creativity, and that individuals should strive to be unique and original in their thinking and behavior.","Abelard's argument against conformality is that, in order to justify his conclusion A is equivalent to B, it is necessary and sufficient for A to be true, but it is also possible and inexplicit to have A true.

What is the role of mental images in thought according to Abelard?,"According to Abelard, mental images have only an instrumental role in thought, describing them as “intermediary signs of things” (intersigna rerum). Intentionality derives instead from the act of attention (attentio) directed upon the mental image. Mental images are inert and require interpretation in order to function significatively. The selfsame image can be used to think about different things, so there is no intrinsic feature of the mental image in virtue of which it is about any given thing.","According to Abelard, mental images play a significant role in thought. He believed that mental images are essential for the formation of thoughts and that they help us to understand the world around us. Abelard believed that mental images are not just visual representations but also involve the use of language, memory, and imagination.

What conclusion does Abelard draw about intentionality?,"Abelard concludes that intentionality is a primitive and irreducible feature of the mind, our acts of attending to things. Different acts of attention are intrinsically different from one another; they are about what they are about in virtue of being the kind of attention they are. Therefore, Abelard adopts what is nowadays called an adverbial theory of thought.","Abelard concludes that intentionality is a fundamental aspect of the human mind and that it is the basis for all human behavior. He argues that intentionality is the ability to plan, reason, and act with purpose and intention, which is what distinguishes humans from other animals.","Abelard concludes that intentionality is a property of propositions. However, he also notes that this property is not independent of other properties of statements, such as truthness and coherence, and that it is not clear what this property is.

This principle is based on the idea that the good life is not simply a matter of individual choice, but rather requires a balance between virtue and vice, and that the path to this balance is found through moderation and moderate action.","Abelard takes the principle that action is ruled by reason to be the rational core of traditional Christian morality. However, some have argued that this principle is incoherent or incompatible with other principles of action, such as maximizing one's utilities or maximizing one's happiness.

What is the example Abelard uses to illustrate his point that ignorance does not necessarily make an action immoral?,"Abelard uses the example of the crucifiers of Christ to illustrate his point that ignorance does not necessarily make an action immoral. He argues that the crucifiers of Christ were not evil in crucifying Jesus, because their ignorance of Christ’s divine nature did not make them evil. He also argues that they would have sinned had they thought crucifying Christ was required and did not crucify Christ, because failing to abide by one’s conscience in moral action renders the agent blameworthy.","In the example Abelard gives, he describes a situation where a person is ignorant of the consequences of their actions. The person is unaware of the harm they are causing to others, and they continue to act without regard for the consequences. This example illustrates Abelard's point that ignorance does not necessarily make an action immoral, as the person is still responsible for their actions and may face consequences in the future.","Abelard gives the example of a man who, when he hears a woman singing, assumes that she is singing a love song and tries to seduce her.

He argues that acting on such desires is done “of” will, but not voluntarily, and that there is nothing evil in desire itself, only in acting on it.","In Abelard's philosophy, the distinction is between wanting to do something and wanting to want to do something. Wanting to do something refers to a desire or intention to act or perform a particular action, while wanting to want to do something refers to a desire or intention to desire or want to act or perform a particular action.

What are the two cases Abelard uses to argue that human justice can even be just to punish an agent we strongly believe had no evil intention?,"Abelard uses two cases to argue that human justice can even be just to punish an agent we strongly believe had no evil intention. The first case is a woman who accidentally smothers her baby while trying to keep it warm at night and is overcome with grief. Abelard maintains that we should punish her for the beneficial example her punishment may have on others. The second case is a judge who may have excellent (but legally impermissible) evidence that a witness is perjuring himself. Since he cannot show that the witness is lying, the judge is forced to rule on the basis of the witness’s testimony that the accused, whom he believes to be innocent, is guilty. Abelard argues that human justice may with propriety ignore questions of intention in this case as well.","Abelard uses the cases of the murderer and the thief to argue that human justice can even be just to punish an agent we strongly believe had no evil intention. In the murder case, the murderer is innocent and the victim is innocent, and the murderer's guilt is not proven beyond a reasonable doubt. In the thief case, the thief is innocent and the victim is innocent, and the thief's guilt is not proven","In the two cases Abelard uses to argue that human justice can even be just to punish an agent we strongly believe had no evil intention, what is the case that he argues? He argues that it is even just to punish the criminal who has committed a heinous crime, but not to punish the innocent person who was involved in the crime. But Abelard also argues that the case for which it is even just to punish the criminal, namely, that the punishment is the best deterrent, can be met only in the case in which the criminal has committed a heinous crime and the victim is innocent.

In particular, he argues that the Afterlife is a condition to which we ought to aspire, that it is a moral improvement even on the life of virtue in this world, and that recognizing this is constitutive of wanting to do what God wants, that is, to live according to the Golden Rule, which guarantees as much as anything can (pending divine grace) our long-term postmortem happiness.","According to Abelard, happiness and virtue are not mutually exclusive.

How does Abelard use his theory of identity to explain the Trinity?,"Abelard explains the Trinity by stating that the three Persons are essentially the same as one another, since they are all the same concrete thing (namely God). They differ from one another in definition, since what it is to be the Father is not the same as what it is to be the Son or what it is to be the Holy Spirit. The three Persons are numerically different from one another, for otherwise they would not be three, but they are not numerically different from God: if they were there would be three gods, not one. Moreover, each Person has properties that uniquely apply to it—unbegotten to the Father, begotten to the Son, and proceeding to the Holy Spirit—as well as properties that are distinctive of it, such as power for the Father, wisdom for the Son, and goodness for the Holy Spirit. The unique properties are unmixed in Abelard’s technical sense, for the Persons differ from one another in their unique properties, and such properties do not apply to God; the distinctive properties are mixed, though, in that God is characterized by each (the powerful God is the wise God is the good God).

What is the Sarvāstivāda-Vaibhāṣika understanding of the spatio-temporal existence of dharmas?,"The Sarvāstivāda-Vaibhāṣika understanding of the spatio-temporal existence of dharmas is that it is determined by their distinctive causal functioning. Past and future dharmas have capability of functioning, while present dharmas also exert a distinctive activity. Present activity is an internal causal efficacy that assists in the production of an effect within a dharma’s own consciousness series. It is this activity that determines a dharma’s present existence and defines the limits of the span of its present moment. Capability, by contrast, is a conditioning efficacy externally directed towards another consciousness series: it constitutes a condition that assists another dharma in the production of its own effect.

Horizontal causality produces the next moment of the same consciousness series, while vertical causality produces a different effect and connects the dharma with the incessant rise and fall of other dharmas, further individuating it as that very particular dharma by manifesting its unique quality and intensity of operation.","The Sarvāstivāda-Vaibhāṣika view holds that causality is horizontal, meaning that it flows from cause to effect in a straight line, while the Sautrāntika view holds that causality is vertical, meaning that it flows from effect to cause in a circular or spiral pattern.

"What shift in emphasis in the Abhidharma is indicated by the terms ""particular inherent characteristic"" and ""general characteristic""?","The shift in emphasis in the Abhidharma indicated by the terms ""particular inherent characteristic"" and ""general characteristic"" is a shift towards reducing the phenomenal, causally conditioned world into the activity of cognition and consciousness. This shift was part of a broader movement in Indian philosophy in which Hindu, Jain, and Buddhist thinkers turned away from traditional metaphysical questions about the nature of the external world and the self, and focused instead on the study of epistemology, logic, and language. Their purpose was to provide systematic accounts of the nature and means of valid cognition. Within Buddhist circles, this epistemological turn saw the rise of thinkers such as Asaṅga and Vasubandhu, the founders of the Yogācāra (400–480 CE), and, most notably, Dignāga and Dharmakīrti (around 500 CE) who developed sophisticated logical and philosophical systems.","The shift in emphasis in the Abhidharma is indicated by the terms ""particular inherent characteristic"" and ""general characteristic"" because the former emphasizes the specific nature of a particular inherent characteristic, while the latter emphasizes the general nature of a general characteristic.
