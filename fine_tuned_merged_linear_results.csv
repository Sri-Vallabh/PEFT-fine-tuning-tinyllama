What is the second sense in which the term abduction is used in the philosophical literature?,"In the second sense, the term abduction refers to the place of explanatory reasoning in justifying hypotheses. In this sense, it is also often called “Inference to the Best Explanation.”","Response: In the philosophical literature, the term abduction refers to two senses: (a) as a method of proof in epistemology, where it is used to establish the truth of a claim by its evidential support, and (b) as a mode of reasoning in metaphysics, where it is used to investigate the nature of things by means of their exemplary properties, rather than by means of their causal relations with other things.</|im_end|>",0.850183367729187,0.8265485763549805,0.8752095699310303

What is an example of abduction that is also referred to as “Inference to the Best Explanation”?,"An example of abduction that is also referred to as “Inference to the Best Explanation” is seeing what looks like a picture of Winston Churchill in the sand and inferring that someone intentionally drew a picture of Churchill in the sand, as opposed to the more complex explanation that it is the trace of an ant crawling on the beach.","An example of abduction that is also referred to as “Inference to the Best Explanation” is the process of reasoning that investigates a fact or process that best explains another fact or process within its scope.

What is the distinction between deductive inferences and inductive/abductive inferences?,"The distinction between deductive inferences and inductive/abductive inferences corresponds to the distinction between necessary and non-necessary inferences. In deductive inferences, what is inferred is necessarily true if the premises from which it is inferred are true; that is, the truth of the premises guarantees the truth of the conclusion. In contrast, in inductive and abductive inferences, the truth of the premises does not guarantee the truth of the conclusion.","The distinction between deductive inferences and inductive/abductive inferences is that the former are based on rules of logical and mathematical reasoning that guarantee the validity of their premises and the existence of their logical functioning, while the latter are based on rules that guarantee the validity of their premises but are not logical in the same sense as the former.",0.8879534602165222,0.8815631866455078,0.8944370746612549

What type of reasoning does Harman conceive induction as?,Harman conceives induction as a special type of abduction.,"Harman conceives induction as a type of sensory-motor reasoning that involves the integration of sensory information into a representational system specific to movement (e.g., the perception of touch) and action (e.g., making a move).",0.8912761807441711,0.8412754535675049,0.9475960731506348
What is the difference between abduction and induction?,"Abduction and induction are both ampliative, meaning that the conclusion goes beyond what is (logically) contained in the premises. However, in abduction there is an implicit or explicit appeal to explanatory considerations, whereas in induction there is not. In induction, there is only an appeal to observed frequencies or statistics, while in abduction there may also be an appeal to frequencies or statistics.","According to Lewis, abduction involves a process of reasoning from observed to hypothetical causal relations, while induction involves a process of reasoning from observed to expected or actual events.",0.8583616614341736,0.8688831329345703,0.8480919599533081
Can adding a premise to a set of premises used for abduction make it impossible to infer a conclusion that was possible with the original set of premises?,"Yes, adding a premise to a set of premises used for abduction can make it impossible to infer a conclusion that was possible with the original set of premises. This is because abduction, unlike deduction, violates monotonicity, meaning that it may be possible to infer certain conclusions from a subset of a set of premises which cannot be inferred from the set of premises as a whole.","Yes, adding a premise to a set of premises used for abduction can make it impossible to infer a conclusion that was possible with the original set of premises if that original set of premises was inevitably false or incomplete when the hypothesis was made.",0.9162482619285583,0.9284306764602661,0.9043814539909363

Timothy Williamson goes further to say that the abductive methodology is the best science provides and Ernan McMullin even calls abduction “the inference that makes science.”,"Philosophers of science have argued that the primary use of the theory involved in our everyday language of science, the model of nature in question, is to explain the observed phenomena, and that this use is either ex ante or ex nihilo (in advance of any evidence) and either pre-theoretical or empirical (involving only sensory perceptions) or post-theoretical and involving communicable knowledge (involving communicated procedures, such as experiments, or communicated sensory perceptions).",0.8344181776046753,0.8150714635848999,0.8547055125236511
What is an example of abduction?,"An example of abduction is when two astronomers, John Couch Adams and Urbain Leverrier, suggested that there was an eighth, as yet undiscovered planet in the solar system to explain why Uranus' orbit deviated from the orbit as predicted by Isaac Newton’s theory of universal gravitation.","An example of abduction is the process by which a scientist desires to explain a particular phenomenon in terms of another, more fundamental phenomenon. For example, a physicist may want to explain the emission of electromagnetic radiation in terms of light, but will first have to abduct the idea of light from its container, the electromagnetic wave that contains all the information about the emission.

What is one of the philosophical debates in which abduction plays a central role?,"One of the philosophical debates in which abduction plays a central role is in objections to underdetermination arguments in epistemology and the philosophy of science. Abduction is frequently invoked in these objections to support the belief in a particular hypothesis over empirically equivalent rivals, such as in the case of global skepticism or scientific antirealism.","One of the philosophical debates in which abduction plays a central role is the debate over methodology, where representationalism and empiricism are opposed and it is asked whether we can scientifically investigate our external world by means other than sensory perception.",0.8764582872390747,0.887916088104248,0.8652923703193665
What is one example of how abduction has been used in epistemology to argue against skepticism?,"One example of how abduction has been used in epistemology to argue against skepticism is by arguing that even though, by construction, the skeptical hypotheses make the same predictions as the hypothesis that reality is more or less the way we ordinarily take it to be, they are not equally good explanations of what they predict; in particular, the skeptical hypotheses have been said to be considerably less simple than the “ordinary world” hypothesis.","One example of how abduction has been used in epistemology to argue against skepticism is in the work of John Searle, who argues that because our epistemic standards of truth are relative to each other, it is impossible for our knowledge to be a basis for final moral truth-appeal, which would require a universal standard of truth, or for our knowledge to be exempt from skepticism, which would require a non-relational epistemology.

"What is the problem with the theoretical virtues of simplicity, generality, and coherence with well-established theories, which are often used to determine the best explanation?","The problem is that none of the theoretical virtues are well understood. Giere even makes the radical claim that the theoretical virtues lack real content and play no more than a rhetorical role in science. However, recent formal work on simplicity and coherence, as well as psychological evidence on people’s assessments of explanatory goodness, cast doubt on this claim.","The problem with the theoretical virtues of simplicity, generality, and coherence with well-established theories is that they are often used to determine the best explanation, and yet it is often impossible to determine which of these properties is the most important in any given case, since the evidence available may be too incomplete or too variable to allow for a single most important property. Additionally, because the evidence available is often incomplete and variable, it is difficult to determine how much weight to give to each of these properties in turn, or to determine which of them are most essential to the truth of the matter in question. Lastly, because the evidence available is often incomplete and variable, it is also difficult to determine which of these properties is the most relevant to the best explanation of a given matter, since different cases may be best explained by different combinations of these properties.",0.8461195230484009,0.8347492218017578,0.8578039407730103
What do some philosophers believe about abduction and the best explanation?,"Some philosophers believe that abduction warrants an inference only to the probable truth of the best explanation, others that it warrants an inference only to the approximate truth of the best explanation, and still others that it warrants an inference only to the probable approximate truth.","Some philosophers believe that the materialist epistemology that rules over our modern scientific and technological era is incompatible with the philosophical tradition that emphasizes the role of reason in our knowledge of the world, and that to toothlessly rebut such epistemology is to go beyond the question.

What is a simple procedure that can be used to ensure that the best explanation is not missed when generating a set of candidate explanations?,"A simple procedure that can be used to ensure that the best explanation is not missed when generating a set of candidate explanations is to define a new hypothesis as the negation of all the previous hypotheses, and add this new hypothesis as a further candidate explanation to the ones already considered. This procedure guarantees that the set of candidate explanations is exhaustive, in that one of its elements must be true. This proposal is similar to the one made by Lipton (1993).","A simple procedure that can be used to ensure that the best explanation is not missed when generating a set of candidate explanations is to require that for every actual feature x, the probability assigned to it in the generated set bears at least as much as its probability assigned by its corresponding model in the data (the “exact” probability rule).",0.8848590850830078,0.885792076587677,0.883928120136261

What are some possible advantages of following a probabilistically incoherent rule instead of Bayes’ rule?,"Some possible advantages of following a probabilistically incoherent rule instead of Bayes’ rule include approaching the truth faster and assigning a high probability to the true hypothesis more quickly. These advantages may not be easily expressed in terms of money, but they should still be taken into account when deciding which rule to follow.","If the matter is smooth, and the agent is able to make use of the full range of ordinary perceptual and causal detective information, then following a probabilistically incoherent rule rather than Bayes’ rule may have the advantage of being more efficient in determining the agent’s beliefs. If the matter is not smooth, or if the agent is in a state of extreme mental distraction, then following a probabilistically incoherent rule may be less likely to be misleading, and may be more likely to lead to more reliable and consistent results than Bayes’ rule.

What is the view of Douven (1999) regarding the question of whether a probabilistic rule is coherent?,"Douven (1999) argues that the question of whether a probabilistic rule is coherent cannot be settled independently of considering which other epistemic and decision-theoretic rules are deployed along with it. Coherence should be understood as a property of packages of both epistemic and decision-theoretic rules, not of epistemic rules in isolation. Douven also describes a coherent package of rules that includes a probabilistic version of abduction.","In chapter 5 of his book, Douven (1999) rejects the view that a probabilistic rule is coherent in the sense that it is a systematic connection between factual antecedents and effects, on the grounds that it would be to give up the epistemic analogy between perception and action and the requirement that a rule be systematic in this sense would also be to give up the requirement that our judgments of truth be inseparably connected with our actions.</|im_end|>",0.8456548452377319,0.832176148891449,0.8595774173736572

What is the distinction between premise-circularity and rule-circularity?,"An argument is premise-circular if its conclusion is amongst its premises.

Here is a rough explanation:
Premise-circularity is the condition in which the speaker's action is inevitably determined by its premises, in the sense that the action's normative content is determined by its logical structure. This means that the action's normative content is determined by its logical structure in such a way that no other explanation of the action is possible apart from its premises. In other words, the action's normative content is determined by its circularity.
Rule-circularity, on the other hand, is the condition in which the action's normative content is not necessarily determined by its logical structure in this way. Instead, the action's normative content is not necessarily determined by its premises in the same way that",0.8410874605178833,0.8236684799194336,0.8592589497566223
"What is the problem with the argument that justifies the use of ""Inference to the Worst Explanation"" (IWE) by showing that it leads to the worst explanation of the fact that theories are unsuccessful?","The problem with this argument is that it leads to an utterly absurd conclusion, namely that IWE is a reliable rule of inference. This is not a problem of vicious circularity, but rather a problem with the argument's leading to an unacceptable conclusion","The problem with the argument that justifies the use of IWE by showing that it leads to the worst explanation of the fact that theories are unsuccessful is that it fails to account for cases where the best explanation is not the worst one, such as when a person is deceived by a false theory or when the evidence against a theory is so weak that it is impossible to know which of its components are true and which are false.",0.8641790151596069,0.8526215553283691,0.8760542273521423
What is the additional condition Psillos posits for a rule-circular argument to be valid?,The additional condition Psillos posits for a rule-circular argument to be valid is that one should not have reason to doubt the reliability of the rule—that there is nothing currently available which can make one distrust the rule.,"For a rule-circular argument to be valid, Psillos adds that it must be a matter of identical things that their subjective Truth Values are (not merely relative) different persons to be (in order to be) Good and Infallible Justices.",0.8670544624328613,0.8549883961677551,0.8794658184051514
What is the purpose of philosophical argumentation according to Psillos?,"According to Psillos, the purpose of philosophical argumentation is not always to convince an opponent of one’s position, but sometimes to assure or reassure oneself that the position one endorses or is tempted to endorse is correct.","According to Psillos, philosophical argumentation is the discovery of the truth about the world by means of analogy between its components, each of which is understood in its own specificational way and by means of means that are general and abstract. Thus, the purpose of philosophical argumentation is to discover the universal properties of the world as a whole.",0.8680988550186157,0.8613893389701843,0.8749135732650757
How can the reliability of abduction be supported using enumerative induction?,"The reliability of abduction can be supported using enumerative induction by arguing that every newly recorded successful application of abduction, such as the discovery of Neptune, adds further support to the hypothesis that abduction is a reliable rule of inference, in the way in which every newly observed black raven adds some support to the hypothesis that all ravens are black.","To support the reliability of abduction using enumerative induction, the author provides the following:
"". . . since the matter of the sensations that enter into the perception of an object is itself determinate, and since this matter is in each perception different, and also since the perception of an object is caused by its immediate surroundings, and furthermore, since the perception of an object is subject to change over time, and since the causes of its perception are also subject to change.""

How can Bayesians determine their prior probabilities and likelihoods?,"According to Lipton, Bayesians ought to determine their prior probabilities and likelihoods on the basis of explanatory considerations.","Bayesians can determine their prior probabilities and likelihoods by first specifying their assumptions about the world, such as its features and its history, and then calculating the probabilities and likelihoods that these assumptions give rise to. They then use these calculations to adjust their prior probabilities and likelihoods as needed to best account for the evidence available to us.",0.8824829459190369,0.873688817024231,0.891455888748169
What is the issue with assigning priors in the context of Lipton’s recommendation to the Bayesian to be an explanationist?,"The issue is that any reason for fixing one’s priors counts as legitimate by Bayesian standards, and one assignment of priors is as good as another, provided both are coherent. So, it is not clear what one should do differently if one wants to follow the recommendation. Should one give the same prior to any best explanation that one’s neighbor gives, that is, lower one’s priors for best explanations? Or rather should one give even higher priors to best explanations than those one already gives?","The issue with assigning priors in the context of Lipton’s recommendation to the Bayesian to be an explanationist is that it would require a non-reductive theory of knowledge to account for our epistemic subsystem’s ability to make sense of the world, which is not only incompatible with the empiricalism of modern science but also, on the Bayesian’s view, incoherent with it.",0.8445049524307251,0.8490563035011292,0.840002179145813
What is the idea of Lipton's proposal?,"The idea of Lipton's proposal is that, as long as one does assign highest priors to those hypotheses that are the best explanations, everything is fine, or at least finer than if one does not do so, regardless of one’s reasons for assigning those priors.","The idea of Lipton's proposal is that to understand a statement as a programmed system, we should be able to replace the names of its components with mathematical functions.",0.8708673119544983,0.8903570175170898,0.85221266746521
What are some reasons that a hypothesis may be considered a better explanation than its rivals before any data are known?,"A hypothesis may be considered a better explanation than its rivals before any data are known because it requires less complicated mathematics, because it is stated in terms of familiar concepts only, or because of internal features of the hypothesis that can be evaluated without having to observe the world.",Some reasons that a hypothesis may be considered a better explanation than its rivals before any data are known are: (1) it is more specific than its rivals; (2) it is more likely to be testable; (3) it has a more complex structure; (4) it has been subject to preliminary experimental testing with favorable results; (5) it has a more convincing explanatory function. Each of these reasons has both qualitative and quantitative components.,0.8790144324302673,0.8649514317512512,0.8935422897338867
What is the Principle of Indifference and what is its problem?,"The Principle of Indifference is a principle that, when there is no reason to favor one hypothesis over another, one should assign equal priors to competing hypotheses. The problem with this principle is that there are typically various ways to partition logical space that appear plausible given the problem at hand, and that not all of them lead to the same prior probability assignment, even assuming the Principle of Indifference. This makes the Principle of Indifference inconsistent and thus not a principle of rationality.","The Principle of Indifference asserts that every action is either open to the same good as its endorser or else equally bad. This principle has as its problem the presence of arbitrary agency, in the sense that it denies that our actions are determined by their contextual surroundings in a way that is independent of any agent who performs them. Since the good that each action offers is determined by its surroundings, there is no way for us to know what our endorsers would want if they knew what was going to be offered to them, and so no way for us to know what our actions are for for those who receive them",0.8444520235061646,0.8286112546920776,0.8609102964401245
How can explanatory considerations be used in Bayesian reasoning?,"Explanatory considerations can be used as a heuristic to determine priors and likelihoods in cases where we would otherwise be clueless and could do no better than guessing. This is because we are not always able to assign a prior to every hypothesis of interest, or to say how probable a given piece of evidence is conditional on a given hypothesis.","In Bayesian reasoning, explanatory considerations such as the data's probabilities and the hypotheses being made can be used to assess the credibility of each theory's claims and to weight the evidence against each theory according to its evidential support. This way, when deciding which theory to believe, we take into account not just the evidence that has been presented but also the evidence that has been ruled out by other theories as well.",0.8585761785507202,0.8613364696502686,0.8558335304260254
What role does Psillos assign to abduction in his proposal to supplement Bayesian confirmation theory?,"Psillos assigns a role to abduction in his proposal to supplement Bayesian confirmation theory where abduction assists in selecting plausible candidates for testing, and the actual testing then follows Bayesian lines. However, he concedes that this proposal assigns a role to abduction that will strike committed explanationists as being too limited.","Psillos argues that abduction is a necessary but ineffectual mode of reasoning in his proposal to supplement Bayesian confirmation theory, on the basis that it is a non-rational, non-logical, and subjective mode of knowledge transmission that operates through sensory perceptions and bodily actions rather than through reasoned arguments and evidence.",0.8762006163597107,0.870032787322998,0.8824565410614014
What is a possible relationship between abduction and Bayesianism?,"A possible relationship between abduction and Bayesianism is that they operate in different modes of reasoning. Abduction could have its home in the epistemology of belief, and be called upon whenever we reason about our beliefs in a categorical mode, while at the same time Bayes’ rule could have its home in the epistemology of degrees of belief.","A possible relationship between abduction and Bayesianism is that abduction is a mode of inference that uses evidence to modify our prior distributions, while Bayesianism is a theory of probability that assumes a single, best-in-motion distribution over possible theories for each question-answerer for the sake of ease in reasoning. However, this is a oversimplification of the relationship between abduction and Bayesianism, as there are also differences in the kinds of evidence that can be used in each mode of inference and the assumptions that underlie each theory of probability.",0.8655329942703247,0.8585540056228638,0.8726263046264648
What is the difference between abduction and induction?,"Abduction is the process of forming a hypothesis to explain surprising observations, while induction is the process of inferring general laws from particular instances.","According to Lewis, abduction involves a process of reasoning from observed to hypothetical causal relations, while induction involves a process of reasoning from observed to expected or actual events.",0.8846806883811951,0.8823744058609009,0.8869990110397339
What is the problem of induction according to Charles Sanders Peirce?,"The problem of induction, according to Charles Sanders Peirce, is that we can never be sure that the conclusions we draw from our observations are true, because we can never observe everything. Instead, we must rely on abduction, or inference to the best explanation, to justify our hypotheses. This means that we must choose the simplest and most likely explanation for our observations, but we can never be completely certain that it is correct. This is a challenge for scientific realism, because it means that we can never know for sure whether our theories accurately reflect the world. Instead, we must always be open to the possibility that new evidence may require us to revise our theories. Skepticism, on the other hand, takes this uncertainty to an extreme, arguing that we can never know anything for certain. However, Peirce argues that this is not a reason to give up on the pursuit of knowledge, but rather a reason to be humble and open-minded in our quest for truth.","According to Charles Sanders Peirce, the problem of induction is that our knowledge of external objects is not absolutely necessary for our moral and political actions, and therefore the evidence we have at our disposal is not entirely informative.",0.8725482225418091,0.89882493019104,0.847764253616333

For example, the term 'animal' has the sense living substance, which is inherently general, and it refers to each individual animal since each is a living substance.","Abelard's view is that the linguistic categories of time, place, and action are not merely local or individual, but are part of a single universal system that extends over all of human experience.",0.8528596758842468,0.8627557754516602,0.8431880474090576
What is the form of a material object according to Abelard?,"The form of a material object just is the configuration of its material parts: “We call the form strictly what comes from the composition of the parts.” For example, the inherence of shape in the statue just is the way in which its bronze is arranged.","According to Abelard, a material object is a combination of two elements: a degree of extension (plurality of particles) and a degree of movement (movement of those particles) distinct from other objects.",0.8562036156654358,0.851801872253418,0.8606511950492859
What are integral wholes according to Abelard?,"According to Abelard, integral wholes are made up of their discrete material parts as configured in a given way. He countenances many types of integral wholes, including collections, structured composites, continuous quantities, geometrical objects, and temporal wholes.","According to Abelard, integral wholes are those things that are made up of parts that are either finite or infinite in number, each of which is a part of another, and each of those parts is itself a part of another. Thus, a tree is an integral tree, each branch being a part of another and each leaf a part of another, and so on.",0.8588299751281738,0.8512942790985107,0.8665003180503845
What is the difference between a mereology and Abelard's theory of substantial integral wholes?,"A mereology is a general theory of the relations of part to whole, whereas Abelard's theory of substantial integral wholes is a specific type of mereology that holds that there are privileged divisions of wholes into their principal parts. Intuitively, some wholes have a natural division that takes precedence over others; a sentence, for example, is divided into words, syllables, and letters, in precisely that order. According to Abelard, the principal parts of a whole are those whose conjunction immediately results in the complete whole. His intent seems to be that the nature of the composition (if any) that defines the integral whole also spells out its principal parts. A house consists of floor, walls, and roof put together in the right way. It is an open question whether each principal part (such as the wall) requires the existence of all of its subparts (every brick). The principal parts of a collection, for example, are just each of the members of the collection, whatever may be the case with any given member’s subparts; the principal parts of an aggregation are the members located in proximity to one another.","The difference between a mereology and Abelard's theory of substantial integral wholes is that for Abelard, every individual thing is a sum of its necessary and contiguous finer things, while for Kant and his followers, every individual thing is a simple, indivisible mass of sensory data, each of which is immediately present to the mind in its various forms.",0.8402096033096313,0.8573070168495178,0.82378089427948
What is the relationship between natural kinds and God's creation of the world?,"According to Abelard, the division of the world into natural kinds is a 'shallow fact' about the world, meaning that it could have been different had God ordained it differently. This suggests that natural kinds are not inherent in the world, but rather are a result of God's creation. Furthermore, Abelard suggests that if the causal powers of things were different, then natural kinds might be different as well, or might not have been as sharply differentiated as they are now. This reinforces the idea that natural kinds are a result of God's creation, rather than inherent in the world itself.","Response: According to Aris Foley, natural kinds are understood to be God's creative acts in the sense that they are the means by which he structured the world in its present form, and in this sense they are divine in their origin. However, since God is transcendent and therefore not human in any real sense, the natural kinds that we have as our material objects are also transcendent. They are the manifestations of God's creative activity that we have in our possession through our sensory perceptions, but they are also divine in their nature, for they are the work of a divine agent who is both human and transcendent.",0.8579583764076233,0.8505992293357849,0.8654460906982422

"What does Abelard mean by ""assertive force""?","Abelard uses the term ""assertive force"" to refer to the way in which a sentence expresses a proposition. For example, the sentence ""Socrates is in the house"" expresses the same proposition whether it is used as an assertion, a question, or a wish. Abelard argues that the propositional content of a sentence can be distinguished from its assertive force, which allows him to make certain distinctions in the way that sentences are used in logic. For instance, the component sentences in a conditional statement are not asserted, even though they have the same content that they would have if they were asserted. Similarly, Abelard defines negation and other propositional connectives purely in terms of their propositional content, so that negation is treated as a truth-functional operator that applies to the content of a sentence, rather than to its assertive force.","Abelard (in his essay ""On Truth"") defines the assertive force of an utterance as ""the force by which the speaker makes his or her proposition, in the sense that it is what the speaker is, and not merely what his or her mind is going to be at the time of utterance.""",0.8421162366867065,0.848284125328064,0.8360374569892883
What does Abelard mean by 'entailment' in the context of his theory of argument?,"In Abelard's theory of argument, 'entailment' refers to a necessary and relevant connection between propositions, where the conclusion is required by the sense of the preceding statement(s) and cannot be otherwise. Abelard often speaks of the sense of the final statement being 'contained' in the sense of the preceding statement(s), and he considers an entailment to be complete when it holds in virtue of the logical form of the propositions involved, meaning that it holds under any uniform substitution in its terms. The traditional four figures and moods of the categorical syllogism and the doctrine of the hypothetical syllogism are all instances of complete entailments, or valid inferences, in Abelard's theory.","Abelard (in his essay ""On the Evidences of Scripture"") defines 'entailment' as 'the transmission by means of a text of its authoritative meaning, whether that meaning be that of the divine writer or that of his hearers', which seems to be a reasonable definition for a theory of argument that emphasizes the transmission of epistemic content by means of written texts.</|im_end|>

What is the concept of signification in Abelard's philosophy?,"In Abelard's philosophy, signification is the informational content of the concept that is associated with a term upon hearing it, in the normal course of events. Abelard treats signification as both a causal and a normative notion, where the word 'rabbit' ought to cause native speakers of English to have the concept of a rabbit upon hearing it. He insists that the signification is a matter of the informational content carried in the concept, and not mere psychological associations or mental images. Abelard believes that achieving clarity in our concepts is an arduous business, and requires an understanding of how understanding itself works. He also believes that the significations of some names, such as those corresponding to natural-kind terms, are abstractions that include only certain features of the things to which the term refers, and are capable of further determinate specification.","In Abelard's philosophy, signification refers to the way in which the material world is understood by its human subjects, who are teleological and intentional agents, and by means of which they come to know and interpret the divine through their own means. According to Abelard, the material world is not merely accidental to human beings but is their means of knowing and doing things, their instrument of their own nature, their true self, in the sense that it is what they are when they are under the influence of their natural endowments. By signification, then, Abelard means the way in which the material world is understood by and communicated to human beings, their means of knowing and doing things, and the way in which this understanding and communication are bound up with their nature as human beings.",0.8435061573982239,0.8396949768066406,0.8473522067070007
What is the main difference between verbs and names in Abelardian semantics?,"In Abelardian semantics, the main difference between verbs and names is that verbs have connective force (vis copulativa), while names do not.

What is the reason Abelard argues that sentences signify more than just the understandings of the constituent name and verb?,"Abelard argues that sentences signify more than just the understandings of the constituent name and verb because first, a sentence such as ‘Socrates runs’ deals with Socrates and with running, not with anyone’s understandings. Second, sentences like ‘If something is human, it is an animal’ are false if taken to be about understandings, for someone could entertain the concept human without entertaining the concept animal, and so the antecedent would obtain without the consequent. Third, understandings are evanescent particulars, mere mental tokenings of concepts. But at least some consequential sentences are necessary, and necessity can’t be grounded on things that are transitory, and so not on understandings. Sentences must therefore signify something else in addition to understandings, something that can do what mere understandings cannot, which Abelard describes as signifying what the sentence says, calling what is said by the sentence its dictum (plural dicta).",Abelard argues that sentences signify more than just the understandings of the constituent name and verb because they are written in such a way as to convey the act of speaking as well as the subjective experience of the speaker's mind when he or she writes the sentence.,0.8557772636413574,0.8852292895317078,0.8282219171524048

What is the Aristotelian analysis of understanding?,"The Aristotelian analysis of understanding states that understanding is the mind's acquisition of the form of the object that is understood, without its matter. The form of the object is present in the mind or intellective soul, making the mind identical with its object. This theory is called the conformality theory of understanding, as it captures the intuition that understanding inherits or includes properties of what is understood by reducing the intentionality of understanding to the objective identity of the form in the mind and the form in the world.","The Aristotelian analysis of understanding is a system for explaining speech and writing in terms of bodily movements and sensory perceptions of objects, persons, and events.",0.8666513562202454,0.8919153213500977,0.8427791595458984

What do mediaeval philosophers use to explain how a concept is about an object?,"Mediaeval philosophers use mental images, which resemble the objects they are about, to explain how a concept is about an object.

And this explanation is based on the fact that the concept of an object in its simplest form (which includes its name, its number of parts, and its relation to other concepts) is in fact a function of its subject in this way, since to be a part of something else other than itself and having the same property as that concept requires the same means as that concept.</|im_end|>",0.8350066542625427,0.8177136182785034,0.8530468344688416
What is the difference between the conformality theory and the resemblance theory?,"The conformality theory and the resemblance theory are not equivalent despite their common Aristotelian heritage. The transformation of the mind through the inherence of a form is not necessarily the same as the mind’s possession of a concept. Additionally, natural likeness or resemblance need not be understood as identity of form; formal identity need not entail genuine resemblance, due to the different subjects in which the form is embodied.","The conformality theory and the resemblance theory both propose a way of describing the relationship between perceptual features and their corresponding actions, but they differ in their assumptions about what that relationship is like and how to measure it. The conformality theory assumes that perceptual features are causally related to their corresponding actions in a way that is both local and non-invasive, in the sense that the effects of a perceptual feature on its recipient are determined by its presence and orientation within the same mental space as the action that follows it, and that these effects are independent of any intervening mental actions. The resemblance theory, on the other hand, assumes that perceptual features are causally related in a way that is local, non-invasive, and independent of any intervening mental actions but that they also have non-local, causal, and non-invasive relations with their corresponding actions.",0.8403891921043396,0.8275246620178223,0.853659987449646
What is the standard way to reconcile the conformality theory and the resemblance theory of concepts?,"The standard way to reconcile the conformality theory and the resemblance theory of concepts is to take the mind’s possession of a concept to be its ability to transform itself through the inherence of a form, construing formal identity as natural likeness, where having a form in the mind that is identical to the form of the object understood just is to have a mental image of that very object.","To reconcile the conformality theory and the resemblance theory of concepts, we can assume that the mind creates a representation of the world that is both formal and materially extended, and that this extended representation is a function of its formal part (the theory of means) and material part (the sensory information that is presented to us). This representation can be understood as a function of its formal part by virtue of its being a function of its means, which is a function of its mind, and by virtue of its material part by virtue of its being a function of its sensory information, which is also a function of its mind.",0.8601648211479187,0.845811665058136,0.8750134706497192

What is the role of mental images in thought according to Abelard?,"According to Abelard, mental images have only an instrumental role in thought, describing them as “intermediary signs of things” (intersigna rerum). Intentionality derives instead from the act of attention (attentio) directed upon the mental image. Mental images are inert and require interpretation in order to function significatively. The selfsame image can be used to think about different things, so there is no intrinsic feature of the mental image in virtue of which it is about any given thing.","According to Abelard, mental images are of two kinds: (a) sensory images, or representations of things as they are in their materially moving bodies, and (b) representational images, or representations of things as they are in their intellectual essences or functions.",0.8427824974060059,0.8517544269561768,0.8339975476264954
What conclusion does Abelard draw about intentionality?,"Abelard concludes that intentionality is a primitive and irreducible feature of the mind, our acts of attending to things.

Therefore, Abelard adopts what is nowadays called an adverbial theory of thought.","Abelard draws that intentionality is a kind of action that is both causally and psychologically related to its subject’s action, in the sense that the action’s properties are determined by its subject’s properties (moral, sexual, etc.) when it is undertaken.",0.8572583198547363,0.8644635677337646,0.850172221660614

What is the distinction Abelard makes between wanting to do something and wanting to want to do something?,"Abelard distinguishes between wanting to do something and wanting to want to do something by noting that we often want to perform an action but do not want to suffer the consequences of that action, and that sometimes our bodies react with pleasure and desire independently of our wills. He argues that acting on such desires is done “of” will, but not voluntarily, and that there is nothing evil in desire itself, only in acting on it.","Abelard distinctions between wanting to do something and wanting to want to do something on different grounds. He regards wanting to do something as a matter of fact, that is, something that is in the mind, and hence action-ready, irresistible, and immediate, whether one wants to do it or not, while wanting to want to do something is a matter of disposition, that is, something that is in the mind but not action-ready, and hence subject to change, conditional, and contemplative, whether one wants to do it or not, but only insofar as one has the disposition to do it. Hence, to want to do something is to be a doer of what one wants to do, and to want to want to do something is to be a seeker after what one wants to be, and to be contemplative of that.",0.8632313013076782,0.8542882204055786,0.8723635077476501
What are the two cases Abelard uses to argue that human justice can even be just to punish an agent we strongly believe had no evil intention?,"Abelard uses two cases to argue that human justice can even be just to punish an agent we strongly believe had no evil intention. The first case is a woman who accidentally smothers her baby while trying to keep it warm at night and is overcome with grief. Abelard maintains that we should punish her for the beneficial example her punishment may have on others. The second case is a judge who may have excellent (but legally impermissible) evidence that a witness is perjuring himself. Since he cannot show that the witness is lying, the judge is forced to rule on the basis of the witness’s testimony that the accused, whom he believes to be innocent, is guilty. Abelard argues that human justice may with propriety ignore questions of intention in this case as well.","Abelard uses two cases in order to argue that human justice can even be just to punish an agent we strongly believe had no evil intention, including one where the agent is a liar and another where he is the victim of a crime committed by someone else.",0.8903628587722778,0.923944354057312,0.8591368198394775
What is the problem with Abelard's position that the only certifiable sin is acting against one's conscience?,"The problem with Abelard's position is that if we cannot look to the intrinsic value of the deeds or their consequences, and conscience has no reliable guide, then his position seems to open the floodgates to well-meaning subjectivism. In other words, people would be free to do whatever they believe is right, even if it is not objectively so, which could lead to chaos.",Abelard's position that the only certifiable sin is acting against one's conscience is that it neglects the diverse ways in which human beings sin and the need for moral judgment and reform.,0.8572005033493042,0.8685262203216553,0.8461663722991943
What is the problem that Abelard's solution to the problem of how obedience to God's will can be a matter of the agent's intention conforming to a formal criterion leads to?,"The problem that Abelard's solution leads to is that even if we grant that an agent's intentions conform to the Golden Rule, it is not clear why the agent should care about this conformity. In other words, even if Abelard were right about morality, it is not clear why an agent should be moral.",The problem that Abelard's solution to the problem of how obedience to God's will can be a matter of the agent's intention conforming to a formal criterion leads to is that it requires the agent to be a perfect agent in order to fulfill his duty.,0.8991584181785583,0.9053001999855042,0.8930994272232056
What is Abelard's view on the relationship between happiness and virtue?,"Abelard believes that our happiness is linked to virtue, which is habitual morally correct behavior. He argues that reason can prove that a merely naturalistic ethics is insufficient, and that an agent's happiness is necessarily bound up with accepting the principles of traditional Christian belief, including the belief in God and an Afterlife. In particular, he argues that the Afterlife is a condition to which we ought to aspire, that it is a moral improvement even on the life of virtue in this world, and that recognizing this is constitutive of wanting to do what God wants, that is, to live according to the Golden Rule, which guarantees as much as anything can (pending divine grace) our long-term postmortem happiness.","Abelard contends that happiness is a function of good moral character, such that a person's moral character is the primary determinant of his or her happiness. However, he also suggests that the possession of other desirable qualities, such as wealth and power, may also be necessary for happiness, on the grounds that they too are the product of good moral character.",0.8597291707992554,0.8764770030975342,0.8436094522476196

How does Abelard justify the claim that reason can be fruitfully applied to a particular article of faith?,Abelard justifies the claim that reason can be fruitfully applied to a particular article of faith by offering a case study in his own writings where he dialectically investigates the Trinity and elaborates an original theory of identity to address issues surrounding it. He argues that belief in the Trinity is rationally justifiable since as far as reason can take us we find that the doctrine makes sense once the tools of dialectic have been properly employed.,"Abelard reasons that since the act of believing a statement is a act of speech, and speech is a function of nervous system that is subject to induction and revision, apart from the factual content of that statement, it follows that believing a statement is a function of nervous system that is subject to both induction and revision. He further argues that since the content of a religious article of faith is not merely a series of sensory impressions, but rather involves a transcendental element that cannot be explained by our species’ nervous system, it is not a article of faith that can be simply and solely explained by our species’ nervous system.",0.8384163975715637,0.8326660394668579,0.8442467451095581

What is Abelard's view on the relationship between a part and the whole it is a part of?,"Abelard maintains that the part is essentially different from the integral whole of which it is a part, reasoning that a given part is completely contained, along with other parts, in the whole, and so is less than the quantity of the whole.","Abelard's view is that the part and the whole are different in kind but equally real, in that each is a manifestation of a universal simple substance (summa simplea).",0.8771313428878784,0.8762079477310181,0.8780567049980164
What are the two causes of the failure of numerical sameness?,"The two causes of the failure of numerical sameness are: (1) objects are not numerically the same when one has a part that the other does not have, in which case the objects are essentially different as well, and (2) objects are numerically different when neither has a part belonging to the other.",The two causes of the failure of numerical sameness are (a) the difference between the number of attributes that the subject and its agent are concerned with when acting independently and (b) the difference between the number of statements that its functional law makes use of when describing its subject.,0.8866477608680725,0.8906607031822205,0.8826708793640137
What is the difference between sameness and difference in definition and essential and numerical sameness and difference?,"Sameness and difference in definition is roughly analogous to modern theories of the identity of properties, while essential and numerical sameness and difference apply directly to things in the world and are extensional forms of identity. According to Abelard, things are the same in definition when what it is to be one requires that it be the other, and conversely; otherwise they differ in definition.","In relation to the distinction between sameness and difference in definition and essential and numerical sameness and difference, the former is about the same thing as the latter, in that they both describe a property that is either identical in its essence or action for its subject, and both use the term ""same"" in its ordinary sense. However, numerical sameness is a property that is determined by its subject's mode of existence, while essential and numerical sameness are properties that are inherent in their subjects' things-in-truth.",0.8544782996177673,0.8508394360542297,0.8581483364105225
What does Abelard mean by the term 'mixed' in the context of properties?,"In the context of properties, Abelard uses the term 'mixed' to refer to properties that, despite being different in definition, both apply to the selfsame concrete thing as such and also as it is characterized by the other.","Abelard (in his essay ""On the Evil of Reason"") defines 'mixed' in the context of properties as 'of different kinds'.",0.8731788992881775,0.8909666538238525,0.8560874462127686
What is the relationship between a form-matter composite and its matter?,"A form-matter composite and its matter are essentially the same, yet they are not identical. The matter is prior to the composite in terms of properties, while the composite is posterior to its matter. The matter is not characterized by posteriority, and the composite is not characterized by priority. Therefore, the matter and composite are different in property despite being essentially the same.","A form-matter composite is a mixture of mind and matter in such a way that the mind has a definite, independent character that is not simply a product of the matter, and the matter is not simply a functional expression of the mind. Thus, the mind-body dualism involved in the formation of a form-matter composite is a dualism of material substance rather than a dualism of subject and object.",0.8656890988349915,0.8603142499923706,0.8711315393447876
How does Abelard use his theory of identity to explain the Trinity?,"Abelard explains the Trinity by stating that the three Persons are essentially the same as one another, since they are all the same concrete thing (namely God). They differ from one another in definition, since what it is to be the Father is not the same as what it is to be the Son or what it is to be the Holy Spirit. The three Persons are numerically different from one another, for otherwise they would not be three, but they are not numerically different from God: if they were there would be three gods, not one. Moreover, each Person has properties that uniquely apply to it—unbegotten to the Father, begotten to the Son, and proceeding to the Holy Spirit—as well as properties that are distinctive of it, such as power for the Father, wisdom for the Son, and goodness for the Holy Spirit. The unique properties are unmixed in Abelard’s technical sense, for the Persons differ from one another in their unique properties, and such properties do not apply to God; the distinctive properties are mixed, though, in that God is characterized by each (the powerful God is the wise God is the good God). Abelard holds that human reason cannot go further than this, but reason validates the analysis (strictly speaking only a “likeness” or analogy) as far as it can go.","Abelard uses his theory of identity to explain the Trinity by arguing that the divine persons are one in essence but different in degree, and that this difference is caused by their being in a single hypostatic union. He also suggests that this explanation is both logically and psychologically acceptable.",0.837203860282898,0.8636332154273987,0.8123441338539124
Who was William of Champeaux and what was his contribution to philosophy?,"William of Champeaux was a French philosopher and theologian who lived in the 11th and 12th centuries. He was a prominent figure in the development of medieval philosophy and is best known for his work on logic, mereology, relations, and universals. He was a student of Anselm of Canterbury and later became a teacher himself, counting Peter Abelard among his students. William's most significant contribution to philosophy is his theory of universals, which holds that universals are real and exist independently of particular things. This theory was a major topic of debate in medieval philosophy and was challenged by Abelard, who argued that universals are merely mental constructs. William's work on logic and syllogisms was also influential and helped to shape the development of medieval logic. He was a leading figure in the School of Paris, which was a center of learning and philosophical debate in the 12th century. Despite his significant contributions to philosophy, William's work is not widely studied today and is often overshadowed by the more famous philosophers of the medieval period. Nonetheless, his ideas and theories continue to be an important part of the history of philosophy and have had a lasting impact on the development of Western thought",William of Champeaux was a medieval logician and philosopher who made important contributions to the development of modern subjective time and causal reasoning.,0.8688567876815796,0.9064201712608337,0.8342827558517456
What does the term Abhidharma mean in the Buddhist exegetical tradition?,"In the Buddhist exegetical tradition, the term Abhidharma means approximately “higher” or “further” teaching, and it refers both to the doctrinal investigations of the new scholastic movement and to the body of texts yielded by its systematic exposition of Buddhist thought. This body of literature includes the third of the “three baskets” (Skt., tripiṭaka, Pali, tipiṭaka) of the Buddhist canon, namely, the Abhidharma-piṭaka (Pali, Abhidhamma-piṭaka), its commentaries, and later exegetical texts.","In the Buddhist exegetical tradition, the term Abhidharma means “the system of the wise who have understood the Buddha’s teaching” (Mahāmāryāvīlaṁusāsāmāyā).",0.8563359975814819,0.8682988882064819,0.8446983098983765
What is Abhidharma and how does it differ from Sūtrānta?,"Abhidharma is a branch of thought and inquiry that is distinct from Sūtrānta, the system of the Buddha’s discourses. Unlike the earlier Buddhist discourses that are colloquial in nature, the Abhidharma method presents the Buddha’s teachings in technical terms that are carefully defined to ensure analytical exactitude. In content, Abhidharma is distinctive in its efforts to provide the theoretical counterpart to the Buddhist practice of meditation and, more broadly, a systematic account of sentient experience. It does so by analyzing conscious experience into its constituent mental and physical events. Abhidharma is also notable for its dharma theory, which is an overarching inquiry into the nature and interaction of dharmas, and its impact on subsequent Buddhist thought and systematic philosophy.","Abhidharma is a system of philosophical and religious theory that is both more and less than Sūtrānta in several respects. On the one hand, it is more philosophical in that it is a system of logical and mathematical reasoning that extends beyond the realm of religious ritual and sacrifice, and that is based on a system of categories and propositional functions rather than on images and gestures; on the other hand, it is less religious in that it does not presuppose any particular religious system other than its own, and is not intended to be a systematic exposition of religious doctrine. Additionally, Abhidharma is a philosophical system that is both analytic and synthetic, in that it is both a system of logical and mathematical reasoning that can be used to explain the nature of reality and a system of religious doctrine that is intended to be practically useful in the transmission of Buddhist teaching.",0.8653903007507324,0.8618699312210083,0.8689396381378174

What is the distinction made by Buddhist tradition between the Sūtrānta and Abhidharma methods of instructing the teachings?,"Buddhist tradition distinguishes between the Sūtrānta and Abhidharma methods of instructing the teachings by contrasting the Sūtrānta “way of putting things” in partial, figurative terms that require further clarification, versus the Abhidharma exposition and catechism that expound the teachings fully, in non-figurative terms. This coincides with additional distinctions the tradition makes between texts that have implicit meaning versus those that have explicit meaning, and texts that are expressed in conventional terms versus others that are expressed in ultimate terms.","Buddhist tradition makes a distinction between the Sūtrānta and Abhidharma methods of instructing the teachings on the basis that the Sūtrānta is a systematic and systemic explanation of the Buddha's teachings that includes their historical context and cultural significance, while the Abhidharma is a formal and analytical explanation that neglects these aspects and instead focuses on their logical and psychological properties.",0.8896816372871399,0.9026931524276733,0.877039909362793
What was the purpose of using lists in early Buddhist literature?,"The purpose of using lists in early Buddhist literature was to serve as mnemonic devices, as the literature was composed and for some centuries preserved orally. These lists were also powerful mnemonic devices and provided formulaic treatment of doctrinal items that were expounded elsewhere. The use of lists in early Buddhist literature can be traced to the collections of the Buddha’s discourses, where certain texts are arranged according to taxonomic lists, providing formulaic treatment of doctrinal items that are expounded elsewhere. Similar taxonomic lists form the table of contents of the Vibhaṅga and Puggalapaññatti of the Theravāda and the Saṅgītiparyāya and Dharmaskandha of the Sarvāstivāda, which are structured as commentaries on those lists.","To illustrate and explain concepts, rather than merely stating them.",0.8169664144515991,0.8506656885147095,0.7858353853225708
What were some of the factors that contributed to the development of the discursive hermeneutics and argumentative style of Abhidharma literature?,"The development of the discursive hermeneutics and argumentative style of Abhidharma literature was influenced by the institutionalization of Buddhist thought, the transition from oral to written methods of textual transmission, the rise of monastic debates concerning the doctrine among the various Buddhist schools, intellectual assimilation and doctrinal disputes between the Buddhist monastic community and the contemporaneous Sanskrit Grammarians, Jains, and Brahmanical schools with their evolving scholastic and analytical movements. The dialectic format and the display of awareness of differences in doctrinal interpretation are the hallmarks of the Kathāvatthu and the Vijñānakāya. Later on, post-canonical Abhidharma texts became complex philosophical treatises employing sophisticated methods of argumentation and independent investigations that resulted in doctrinal conclusions quite far removed from their canonical antecedents.","Some of the factors that contributed to the development of the discursive hermeneutics and argumentative style of Abhidharma literature include:
• The predominance of logic and rhetoric in ancient Indian intellectual traditions
• The need to defend Buddhist metaphysical and epistemological claims against Hindu rivalry
• The desire to create a coherent and defensible system of religious and philosophical explanation within the Buddhist-Hindu trading-partner community

What is the role of dharmas in the process of sensory perception according to the Abhidharma treatises?,"According to the Abhidharma treatises, dharmas are the objects of mental cognitive awareness, a particular type of consciousness that discerns between the stimuli impinging upon the sense faculties and that emerges when the requisite conditions come together. Dharmas are not merely mental objects like ideas, concepts, or memories. Rather, they are psycho-physical events with diverse capacities by means of which the mind unites and assimilates a particular perception, especially one newly presented, to a larger set or mass of ideas already possessed, thus comprehending and conceptualizing it.","According to the Abhidharma treatises, dharmas are of two kinds: material (sattva) and formal (upasanga) ones. Material dharmas are sensory impressions or their psychological representations, while formal dharmas are linguistic expressions that represent their subject matter, such as words or phrases.

What is the role of citta in the process of sensory perception in Abhidharma?,"In Abhidharma, citta is the epitome of the operation of consciousness and is experienced in the process of sensory perception, which is deemed the paradigm of sentient experience. Citta is always intentional and directed to a particular object that is cognized by means of certain mental factors. It always occurs associated with its appropriate cetasikas or mental factors that perform diverse functions and that emerge and cease together with it, having the same object and grounded in the same sense faculty. Each assemblage of citta and its associated mental factors is conscious of just one object, arises for a brief instant and then falls away, followed by another citta combination that picks up a different object by means of its particular associated mental factors.","In Abhidharma, citta is the ""breath of mind"" or ""breath of the senses,"" which is the vehicle through which perceptual content, or buddhi, or ""intelligent matter,"" or anicca, or ""impermanence,"" or anatta, or ""non-self,"" or anatta, or the cessation, or anatta, or anatta, or the world, or anatta, or anatta, or the mind, or anatta, arrives at its ultimate reference, comes to be.

What is the role of dharmas in Abhidharma?,"In Abhidharma, dharmas are distinct (but interrelated) functions, energies, or causally significant aspects of consciousness moments. They are seen as properties, activities, or patterns of interconnection that construct one’s world, not as static substances. The Abhidharma lists of dharmas are open-ended, reflecting a dynamic conception of dharmas and leaving room for continued debates about what is and is not a dharma. Abhidharma represents the theoretical counterpart to the practice of meditation in the Buddhist path, where the nature of lived experience as based on one’s cognitive apparatus is contemplated by investigating the very nature of one’s mind through meditation practice.","In Abhidharma, dharmas are understood to be the aggregates of conscious experience that are the vehicles of individual buddha-natures (sannyāsa yogīs) and their respective buddha-deities (tantric masters) when they are manifested in bodily form. According to the Buddha's teaching, the aggregates are the means by which the bodhisattva who is the disciple of a good teacher (vigorous yogī) and his or her buddha-father (sacred teacher) realize their own buddhafields, and so forth, through the practice of meditation on them.

How does the practice of discrimination of dharmas help to undermine the solidity of the world we grasp at?,"The practice of discrimination of dharmas helps to undermine the solidity of the world we grasp at by demonstrating that no essence or independent self can be found in any phenomenon or its constituents. This is because all aspects of experience are impermanent, arising and passing away subject to numerous causes and conditions. Even the unconditioned dharmas, which have no cause and no effect, are shown to be not-self. As a result, when one tries to grasp the world of the Dhammasaṅgaṇi or the Paṭṭhāna, it runs through one's fingers.","<|im_start|>assistant
The practice of discrimination of dharmas helps to undermine the solidity of the world we grasp at by showing that our perceptual experiences are not absolutely necessary for our moral and political actions but are rather contingent on a vast array of non-material things, some of which are in fact utterly inert and non-existent. When we think of an action like killing a dog, we are in fact referring to a series of dharmas that together constitute a dog, each of which is both a living being and a dog, each of which was once a dog when it was a puppy and will again be a dog when it dies. In other words, the action of killing a dog is a dharmic action because it involves the simultaneous action of our perceptual dog-dom and its non-perceptual dog-non-dom.",0.8563203811645508,0.8493232131004333,0.863433837890625

Present activity is an internal causal efficacy that assists in the production of an effect within a dharma’s own consciousness series. It is this activity that determines a dharma’s present existence and defines the limits of the span of its present moment. Capability, by contrast, is a conditioning efficacy externally directed towards another consciousness series: it constitutes a condition that assists another dharma in the production of its own effect. A dharma’s present activity arises and falls away, but past and future dharmas all have potential for causal functioning and exist as real entities due to their intrinsic nature.","The Sarvāstivāda-Vaibhāṣika understanding of the spatio-temporal existence of dharmas is that it is a function of cerebral hemispheres that receive and transmute sensory impulses into mental objects (bhāva) in accordance with causes and conditions.

This shift was part of a broader movement in Indian philosophy in which Hindu, Jain, and Buddhist thinkers turned away from traditional metaphysical questions about the nature of the external world and the self, and focused instead on the study of epistemology, logic, and language. Their purpose was to provide systematic accounts of the nature and means of valid cognition.
