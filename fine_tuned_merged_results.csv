What is the distinction between deductive inferences and inductive/abductive inferences?,"The distinction between deductive inferences and inductive/abductive inferences corresponds to the distinction between necessary and non-necessary inferences. In deductive inferences, what is inferred is necessarily true if the premises from which it is inferred are true; that is, the truth of the premises guarantees the truth of the conclusion. In contrast, in inductive and abductive inferences, the truth of the premises does not guarantee the truth of the conclusion.","The distinction between deductive inferences and inductive/abductive inferences is whether the conclusion follows directly from the premises and whether this conclusion is considered to be the best explanation of the matter in question. Deductive inferences are those in which the best explanation of the matter in question is the one inferred from the evidence, while inductive/abductive inferences are those in which the best explanation of the matter in question is not necessarily the one inferred.",0.8958879709243774,0.8907169103622437,0.9011194705963135
What is an example of a case where the truth of the premises does not guarantee the truth of the conclusion?,"An example of a case where the truth of the premises does not guarantee the truth of the conclusion is when we infer that ""John is rich"" from ""John lives in Chelsea"" and ""Most people living in Chelsea are rich"". It is logically compatible with the truth of the premises that John is a member of the minority of non-rich inhabitants of Chelsea.","An example of a case where the truth of the premises does not guarantee the truth of the conclusion is when a person decides to buy a new car and has a prior preference for a sports car, even though the truth of the premises indicates that a SUV is the best choice. This is because the truth of the premises does not guarantee that the sports car will be the best choice, but only that the sports car will be the one that the person decides to buy.

What is the difference between abduction and induction?,"Abduction and induction are both ampliative, meaning that the conclusion goes beyond what is (logically) contained in the premises. However, in abduction there is an implicit or explicit appeal to explanatory considerations, whereas in induction there is not. In induction, there is only an appeal to observed frequencies or statistics, while in abduction there may also be an appeal to frequencies or statistics.","Abduction is the process of inferring a hypothesis or law from a subset of available explanations, while induction is the process of inferring a law or hypothesis from a set of observations. Both are types of inference, but abduction is usually used in hypothetical reasoning, while induction is usually used in descriptive reasoning.",0.8622220754623413,0.8655575513839722,0.8589122891426086
Can adding a premise to a set of premises used for abduction make it impossible to infer a conclusion that was possible with the original set of premises?,"Yes, adding a premise to a set of premises used for abduction can make it impossible to infer a conclusion that was possible with the original set of premises. This is because abduction, unlike deduction, violates monotonicity, meaning that it may be possible to infer certain conclusions from a subset of a set of premises which cannot be inferred from the set of premises as a whole.","Yes, adding a premise to a set of premises used for abduction can make it impossible to infer a conclusion that was possible with the original set of premises. This is because adding a new premise to the set of premises can lead to a conclusion that is not supported by any of the other premises, making it impossible to infer anything from the new premise to the other conclusions in the set of premises. However, it is possible to modify the set of premises such that the new premise does not lead to this conclusion, but this modification may not be possible without changing the original set of premises.",0.9143171310424805,0.9090116620063782,0.9196850061416626

What is one of the philosophical debates in which abduction plays a central role?,"One of the philosophical debates in which abduction plays a central role is in objections to underdetermination arguments in epistemology and the philosophy of science. Abduction is frequently invoked in these objections to support the belief in a particular hypothesis over empirically equivalent rivals, such as in the case of global skepticism or scientific antirealism.","One of the philosophical debates in which abduction plays a central role is in medical diagnosis. Doctors often rely on abduction to make a diagnosis, such as when a patient presents with a fever and the doctor suspects typhoid fever. This is because the symptoms of typhoid fever are similar to those of a fever that a doctor would expect to see in a patient with a rash, diarrhea, and fatigue, but which are not present in all cases of fever. Abduction is used to infer that the patient has typhoid fever.

What is one example of how abduction has been used in epistemology to argue against skepticism?,"One example of how abduction has been used in epistemology to argue against skepticism is by arguing that even though, by construction, the skeptical hypotheses make the same predictions as the hypothesis that reality is more or less the way we ordinarily take it to be, they are not equally good explanations of what they predict; in particular, the skeptical hypotheses have been said to be considerably less simple than the “ordinary world” hypothesis.","An example of abduction in epistemology to argue against skepticism is the argument that the best explanation of a fact, such as a true statement, is a rule that describes that fact, not an individual truth-criterion.

Coherence should be understood as a property of packages of both epistemic and decision-theoretic rules, not of epistemic rules in isolation. Douven also describes a coherent package of rules that includes a probabilistic version of abduction.","Douven (1999) argues that the question of whether a probabilistic rule is coherent is trivially yes, since it is impossible to formulate a coherent version of the rule that does not lead to absurdities. However, he also suggests that it is not impossible to formulate a coherent version of the rule, and that this version is not incompatible with the assumption that the rule is probabilistically coherent.

In the case of a rule, the rule is circular if and only if it is true that, for all premises Pi, you are guaranteed to make a conclusion Ci that is identical to the conclusion made in response to every other premise that you have, where Ci is the conclusion you are guaranteed to make when you make the conclusion Di, for all i such that for some j, you have a special relationship with j that is identical to that which you have with respect to Pi. Rules, on the other hand, are not necessarily circular.",0.8518617153167725,0.8340492844581604,0.8704514503479004
"What is the problem with the argument that justifies the use of ""Inference to the Worst Explanation"" (IWE) by showing that it leads to the worst explanation of the fact that theories are unsuccessful?","The problem with this argument is that it leads to an utterly absurd conclusion, namely that IWE is a reliable rule of inference. This is not a problem of vicious circularity, but rather a problem with the argument's leading to an unacceptable conclusion",The problem with this argument is that it leads to a conclusion that is equally bad as the worst explanation. This is because IWE is a special case of the general rule that says that a rule of inference that involves inference to the worst explanation is a good rule of inference.,0.896808922290802,0.8928558826446533,0.9007971286773682
What is the additional condition Psillos posits for a rule-circular argument to be valid?,The additional condition Psillos posits for a rule-circular argument to be valid is that one should not have reason to doubt the reliability of the rule—that there is nothing currently available which can make one distrust the rule.,The additional condition Psillos posits for a rule-circular argument to be valid is that one should not have reason to doubt the reliability of the rule before one comes to the conclusion ones is going to receive.,0.9495006799697876,0.9468650817871094,0.9521510601043701

How can the reliability of abduction be supported using enumerative induction?,"The reliability of abduction can be supported using enumerative induction by arguing that every newly recorded successful application of abduction, such as the discovery of Neptune, adds further support to the hypothesis that abduction is a reliable rule of inference, in the way in which every newly observed black raven adds some support to the hypothesis that all ravens are black.","The reliability of abduction can be supported using enumerative induction by showing that, when it is used to construct a hypothesis that explains a random sample of future events, the sample is likely to be representative of the entire future course of events.",0.8764037489891052,0.8834131956100464,0.8695046901702881
How can Bayesians determine their prior probabilities and likelihoods?,"According to Lipton, Bayesians ought to determine their prior probabilities and likelihoods on the basis of explanatory considerations.","According to Lipton, the best way to determine one's prior probabilities and likelihoods is to consider the evidence and make a guess about what that guess will do. This guess will typically involve assigning a probability to each hypothesis that is related to the one that best explains the evidence, and a likelihood to each of the other hypotheses that are related to the one that best explains the evidence.",0.8859390020370483,0.8535051941871643,0.9209352135658264
What is the issue with assigning priors in the context of Lipton’s recommendation to the Bayesian to be an explanationist?,"The issue is that any reason for fixing one’s priors counts as legitimate by Bayesian standards, and one assignment of priors is as good as another, provided both are coherent. So, it is not clear what one should do differently if one wants to follow the recommendation. Should one give the same prior to any best explanation that one’s neighbor gives, that is, lower one’s priors for best explanations? Or rather should one give even higher priors to best explanations than those one already gives?","The issue is that, in the context of which the recommendation is made, it is not clear what it means to be an explanationist.

What are some reasons that a hypothesis may be considered a better explanation than its rivals before any data are known?,"A hypothesis may be considered a better explanation than its rivals before any data are known because it requires less complicated mathematics, because it is stated in terms of familiar concepts only, or because of internal features of the hypothesis that can be evaluated without having to observe the world.","A hypothesis may be considered a better explanation than its rivals before any data are known because it is more plausible, because it is more consistent with the known facts, or because it is more likely to be true.

What is the Principle of Indifference and what is its problem?,"The Principle of Indifference is a principle that, when there is no reason to favor one hypothesis over another, one should assign equal priors to competing hypotheses. The problem with this principle is that there are typically various ways to partition logical space that appear plausible given the problem at hand, and that not all of them lead to the same prior probability assignment, even assuming the Principle of Indifference. This makes the Principle of Indifference inconsistent and thus not a principle of rationality.","The Principle of Indifference is a principle that, when true, tells us that, when we assign truth values to statements that are related to a hypothetical premise, we should assign true values to the premise itself and false values to any other statements that are related to the hypothetical premise.",0.8682423233985901,0.8745636940002441,0.862011730670929
How can explanatory considerations be used in Bayesian reasoning?,"Explanatory considerations can be used as a heuristic to determine priors and likelihoods in cases where we would otherwise be clueless and could do no better than guessing.

What role does Psillos assign to abduction in his proposal to supplement Bayesian confirmation theory?,"Psillos assigns a role to abduction in his proposal to supplement Bayesian confirmation theory where abduction assists in selecting plausible candidates for testing, and the actual testing then follows Bayesian lines. However, he concedes that this proposal assigns a role to abduction that will strike committed explanationists as being too limited.","Psillos assigns a role to abduction in his proposal to supplement Bayesian confirmation theory where abduction is seen as a rule-giving procedure that guides the search for the best explanation of a given observation, with the goal of confirming a particular hypothesis.

What is a possible relationship between abduction and Bayesianism?,"A possible relationship between abduction and Bayesianism is that they operate in different modes of reasoning. Abduction could have its home in the epistemology of belief, and be called upon whenever we reason about our beliefs in a categorical mode, while at the same time Bayes’ rule could have its home in the epistemology of degrees of belief.","A possible relationship between abduction and Bayesianism is that they share the assumption that the best explanation is the one that is most likely to be true, which is a version of the rule of parsimony.

What is the difference between abduction and induction?,"Abduction is the process of forming a hypothesis to explain surprising observations, while induction is the process of inferring general laws from particular instances.","Abduction is the process of inferring a hypothesis or law from a subset of available explanations, while induction is the process of inferring a law or fact unrelated to the set of explanations at hand.

What is the problem of induction according to Charles Sanders Peirce?,"The problem of induction, according to Charles Sanders Peirce, is that we can never be sure that the conclusions we draw from our observations are true, because we can never observe everything. Instead, we must rely on abduction, or inference to the best explanation, to justify our hypotheses. This means that we must choose the simplest and most likely explanation for our observations, but we can never be completely certain that it is correct. This is a challenge for scientific realism, because it means that we can never know for sure whether our theories accurately reflect the world. Instead, we must always be open to the possibility that new evidence may require us to revise our theories. Skepticism, on the other hand, takes this uncertainty to an extreme, arguing that we can never know anything for certain. However, Peirce argues that this is not a reason to give up on the pursuit of knowledge, but rather a reason to be humble and open-minded in our quest for truth.","The problem of induction, according to Peirce, is that we cannot be sure that our hypotheses are true, and that what we observe is the same thing as the thing we most want to explain. This is because our experiences are not independent and objective, but rather are shaped by our social and historical context. Instead, Peirce recommends a practice of suspicion, or of always asking why and checking our assumptions. This may seem like a difficult rule to follow, but it is nonetheless the best that we can do under the circumstances.",0.881443202495575,0.8897954821586609,0.8732462525367737

What is the form of a material object according to Abelard?,"The form of a material object just is the configuration of its material parts: “We call the form strictly what comes from the composition of the parts.” For example, the inherence of shape in the statue just is the way in which its bronze is arranged.",An object is a material if it is predicated with a certain form.,0.8576074242591858,0.8709373474121094,0.8446795344352722
What are integral wholes according to Abelard?,"According to Abelard, integral wholes are made up of their discrete material parts as configured in a given way. He countenances many types of integral wholes, including collections, structured composites, continuous quantities, geometrical objects, and temporal wholes.","Abelard defines integral wholes as those things that are, but not necessarily in the sense of being a sum of parts.",0.8567202091217041,0.8688575029373169,0.8449172377586365
What is the difference between a mereology and Abelard's theory of substantial integral wholes?,"A mereology is a general theory of the relations of part to whole, whereas Abelard's theory of substantial integral wholes is a specific type of mereology that holds that there are privileged divisions of wholes into their principal parts. Intuitively, some wholes have a natural division that takes precedence over others; a sentence, for example, is divided into words, syllables, and letters, in precisely that order. According to Abelard, the principal parts of a whole are those whose conjunction immediately results in the complete whole. His intent seems to be that the nature of the composition (if any) that defines the integral whole also spells out its principal parts. A house consists of floor, walls, and roof put together in the right way. It is an open question whether each principal part (such as the wall) requires the existence of all of its subparts (every brick). The principal parts of a collection, for example, are just each of the members of the collection, whatever may be the case with any given member’s subparts; the principal parts of an aggregation are the members located in proximity to one another.","The difference is that Abelard's theory of substantial integral wholes is a theory of relations between whole objects, while a mereology is a theory of categories and the relations between them.",0.8529486656188965,0.8948278427124023,0.8148142099380493
What is the relationship between natural kinds and God's creation of the world?,"According to Abelard, the division of the world into natural kinds is a 'shallow fact' about the world, meaning that it could have been different had God ordained it differently. This suggests that natural kinds are not inherent in the world, but rather are a result of God's creation. Furthermore, Abelard suggests that if the causal powers of things were different, then natural kinds might be different as well, or might not have been as sharply differentiated as they are now. This reinforces the idea that natural kinds are a result of God's creation, rather than inherent in the world itself.","The relationship between natural kinds and God's creation of the world is not specified in religious traditions. However, some religious people have argued that the relationship between natural kinds and God's creation of the world is a metaphysical question that cannot be answered by science.",0.8682673573493958,0.8853464126586914,0.851834774017334

"What does Abelard mean by ""assertive force""?","Abelard uses the term ""assertive force"" to refer to the way in which a sentence expresses a proposition. For example, the sentence ""Socrates is in the house"" expresses the same proposition whether it is used as an assertion, a question, or a wish. Abelard argues that the propositional content of a sentence can be distinguished from its assertive force, which allows him to make certain distinctions in the way that sentences are used in logic. For instance, the component sentences in a conditional statement are not asserted, even though they have the same content that they would have if they were asserted. Similarly, Abelard defines negation and other propositional connectives purely in terms of their propositional content, so that negation is treated as a truth-functional operator that applies to the content of a sentence, rather than to its assertive force.",Abelard means that the assertion of a false premise is a force of reason that makes it more likely that the true conclusion follows.,0.8341972231864929,0.8548649549484253,0.814505398273468
What does Abelard mean by 'entailment' in the context of his theory of argument?,"In Abelard's theory of argument, 'entailment' refers to a necessary and relevant connection between propositions, where the conclusion is required by the sense of the preceding statement(s) and cannot be otherwise. Abelard often speaks of the sense of the final statement being 'contained' in the sense of the preceding statement(s), and he considers an entailment to be complete when it holds in virtue of the logical form of the propositions involved, meaning that it holds under any uniform substitution in its terms. The traditional four figures and moods of the categorical syllogism and the doctrine of the hypothetical syllogism are all instances of complete entailments, or valid inferences, in Abelard's theory.",Abelard means 'entailment' in the sense of 'conveying a truth by means of a premise.',0.8316338658332825,0.8530029058456421,0.8113092184066772

What surprising result did Abelard find in his investigation of the theory of topical inference?,"Abelard found that a valid argument need not correspond to an acceptable conditional sentence, nor conversely, since the requirements on arguments and conditionals differ.","Abelard found that, when a speaker asserts a statement that is true in a certain context and then goes on to state an inference that this statement implies, the inference that the statement is true is topically inferred. Instead of asserting that he believes the statement, the speaker instead asserts that he believes the statement with the help of an inference.",0.8496305346488953,0.8458573818206787,0.8534374833106995

What is the distinction Abelard draws between two semantic properties names possess?,"Abelard draws a distinction between reference (nominatio) and sense (significatio) of names.

What is the difference between proper names and common names?,"Proper names signify a concrete individual and are semantically singular referring expressions, closely allied to indexicals, demonstratives, and singular descriptions. Common names, on the other hand, are semantically allied with expressions that have what Abelard calls “plural signification”. They are like plural nouns in that they refer to every individual in a collection, but unlike plural nouns, they pick out a determinate plurality of individuals on an occasion of use, since their extension is variable.","A proper name is a designation of an individual, such as ""John"" or ""Jane,"" while a common name is a designation of an individual that is used by many people, such as ""John Smith"" or ""Jane Johnson.""",0.8351587057113647,0.8470646142959595,0.8235828280448914
What is the sense in which there is a “common reason” for the imposition of a common name?,"The sense in which there is a “common reason” for the imposition of a common name is that it does not involve any metaphysically common shared ingredient, or indeed appeal to any ingredient at all. Instead, the agreement between Socrates and Plato is real and to be explained by appealing to their each being human, which gives them the same standing as human beings.","There is a sense in which there is a common reason for the imposition of a common name, in that it is the best of all possible names for a given object, or at least a name that is at least as good as any of its competitors. However, this reason is not strictly necessary; one could have imposed a name that is at least as good as the common name, and one could have justified doing so in any of its possible consequences.",0.8534360527992249,0.8510501384735107,0.8558354377746582
What is the concept of signification in Abelard's philosophy?,"In Abelard's philosophy, signification is the informational content of the concept that is associated with a term upon hearing it, in the normal course of events. Abelard treats signification as both a causal and a normative notion, where the word 'rabbit' ought to cause native speakers of English to have the concept of a rabbit upon hearing it. He insists that the signification is a matter of the informational content carried in the concept, and not mere psychological associations or mental images. Abelard believes that achieving clarity in our concepts is an arduous business, and requires an understanding of how understanding itself works. He also believes that the significations of some names, such as those corresponding to natural-kind terms, are abstractions that include only certain features of the things to which the term refers, and are capable of further determinate specification.",The concept of signification in Abelard's philosophy is the idea that a statement is true because it is the best explanation of its truth relative to other statements that are also true. This is also known as the signification principle.,0.8517650365829468,0.8709743022918701,0.8333847522735596
What is the main difference between verbs and names in Abelardian semantics?,"In Abelardian semantics, the main difference between verbs and names is that verbs have connective force (vis copulativa), while names do not. This connective force can only be discharged when verbs are joined with names in the syntactically appropriate way, reminiscent of the ‘unsaturatedness’ of concepts in Frege.","The main difference is that verbs are predicates, while names are not.

What is the basic analysis of a predicative statement for Abelard?,"For Abelard, the basic analysis of a predicative statement recognizes that two fundamentally different linguistic categories are joined together: the name n and the simple verbal function V( ), combined in the well-formed sentence V(n).","The basic analysis of a predicative statement for Abelard is that it is a statement about a thing that is predicated of it by an agent who is acting rationally, and that the reason for this is that the statement is true and the thing is described as being what it describes, and that this is the best explanation of the truth of the statement that can be given.

What is the reason Abelard argues that sentences signify more than just the understandings of the constituent name and verb?,"Abelard argues that sentences signify more than just the understandings of the constituent name and verb because first, a sentence such as ‘Socrates runs’ deals with Socrates and with running, not with anyone’s understandings. Second, sentences like ‘If something is human, it is an animal’ are false if taken to be about understandings, for someone could entertain the concept human without entertaining the concept animal, and so the antecedent would obtain without the consequent. Third, understandings are evanescent particulars, mere mental tokenings of concepts. But at least some consequential sentences are necessary, and necessity can’t be grounded on things that are transitory, and so not on understandings. Sentences must therefore signify something else in addition to understandings, something that can do what mere understandings cannot, which Abelard describes as signifying what the sentence says, calling what is said by the sentence its dictum (plural dicta).","Abelard argues that sentences signify more than just the understandings of the constituent name and verb because they are also signs of what is called the hypothetical content of sentences, which is a reason to believe what is true of the world. This reason is also called the reason for hypothetical content.",0.8569116592407227,0.8851736187934875,0.830398678779602
"What is Abelard's view on dicta, according to the text?","According to the text, Abelard denies that dicta have any ontological standing whatsoever. He calls them “no real things at all” and “absolutely nothing.” They underwrite sentences, but they aren’t real things. He adopts a deflationary account of truth, where the truth of true sentences is not a property inhering in some timeless entity, but no more than the assertion of what the sentence says.","Abelard's view is that dicta are not necessarily true, but they are usually true enough to justify the practice of asserting them in a given context. This view is supported by Abelard's argument that dicta are usually used in a way that implies truth. However, other philosophers, such as Thomas Aquinas and John Philoponius, have criticized Abelard's view.

What theory of intentionality does Abelard propose instead of the conformality and resemblance theories?,Abelard proposes an adverbial theory of thought instead of the conformality and resemblance theories of intentionality.,"Abelard proposes a theory of attention that is similar to the conformality and resemblance theories, but with a difference. The difference is that he does not assume that attention is a heuristic device, meaning that it is a good way of judging whether a hypothesis is true. Instead, he suggests that attention is a heuristic device only in the sense that it is a good way of organizing one’s thoughts and feelings, just as a clock is a heuristic device only in the sense that it tells the time only as well as a clock would. Abelard argues that this difference is not a flaw in the theory of attention, but rather a matter of convenience.",0.8717262744903564,0.8331435322761536,0.914056122303009
What is the Aristotelian analysis of understanding?,"The Aristotelian analysis of understanding states that understanding is the mind's acquisition of the form of the object that is understood, without its matter. The form of the object is present in the mind or intellective soul, making the mind identical with its object. This theory is called the conformality theory of understanding, as it captures the intuition that understanding inherits or includes properties of what is understood by reducing the intentionality of understanding to the objective identity of the form in the mind and the form in the world.","The Aristotelian analysis of understanding is the part of cognition that involves understanding, which is also known as hylereception or apodosis. This is because all other forms of cognition, such as perception, imagination, and reasoning, are subsumed under apodosis. The analysis of understanding is also known as the theory of sensation or the theory of perception.",0.8546164035797119,0.8621565699577332,0.8472070693969727
What is the resemblance theory of understanding?,"The resemblance theory of understanding is the Aristotelian analysis that mental acts are classified according to the distinct degree and kind of resemblance they have to the things that are understood, where the resemblance is understood to be objective and natural.","The resemblance theory of understanding is the hypothesis that when we understand a new concept, we are also able to understand its analogies and relate them to our prior knowledge.",0.883673369884491,0.8991183042526245,0.8687499761581421
What do mediaeval philosophers use to explain how a concept is about an object?,"Mediaeval philosophers use mental images, which resemble the objects they are about, to explain how a concept is about an object.

What is the difference between the conformality theory and the resemblance theory?,"The conformality theory and the resemblance theory are not equivalent despite their common Aristotelian heritage. The transformation of the mind through the inherence of a form is not necessarily the same as the mind’s possession of a concept. Additionally, natural likeness or resemblance need not be understood as identity of form; formal identity need not entail genuine resemblance, due to the different subjects in which the form is embodied.","The conformality theory assumes that the best explanation of a fact is the one that is most like the fact, while the resemblance theory assumes that the best explanation of a fact is the one that most closely resembles the fact. In contrast, the conformal theory assumes that the best explanation of a conformal function is the one that is most like the function, and the resemblance theory that the best explanation of a resemblance function is the one that is most like the function.",0.841575026512146,0.840524435043335,0.8426282405853271
What is the standard way to reconcile the conformality theory and the resemblance theory of concepts?,"The standard way to reconcile the conformality theory and the resemblance theory of concepts is to take the mind’s possession of a concept to be its ability to transform itself through the inherence of a form, construing formal identity as natural likeness, where having a form in the mind that is identical to the form of the object understood just is to have a mental image of that very object.","The standard way to reconcile the conformality theory and the resemblance theory of concepts is to say that they are both true as long as there is a one-to-one correspondence between concepts and their corresponding objects, and to explain why this one-to-one correspondence is the best one-to-one correspondence that can be had without violating either the conformality or the resemblance theories.

What is the role of mental images in thought according to Abelard?,"According to Abelard, mental images have only an instrumental role in thought, describing them as “intermediary signs of things” (intersigna rerum). Intentionality derives instead from the act of attention (attentio) directed upon the mental image. Mental images are inert and require interpretation in order to function significatively.

What conclusion does Abelard draw about intentionality?,"Abelard concludes that intentionality is a primitive and irreducible feature of the mind, our acts of attending to things. Different acts of attention are intrinsically different from one another; they are about what they are about in virtue of being the kind of attention they are. Therefore, Abelard adopts what is nowadays called an adverbial theory of thought.","Abelard concludes that intentionality is a property of propositions. However, he also notes that this property is not independent of other properties of statements, such as truthness and coherence, and that it is not clear what this property is.

However, some have argued that this principle is incoherent or incompatible with other principles of action, such as maximizing one's utilities or maximizing one's happiness.

What is the example Abelard uses to illustrate his point that ignorance does not necessarily make an action immoral?,"Abelard uses the example of the crucifiers of Christ to illustrate his point that ignorance does not necessarily make an action immoral. He argues that the crucifiers of Christ were not evil in crucifying Jesus, because their ignorance of Christ’s divine nature did not make them evil. He also argues that they would have sinned had they thought crucifying Christ was required and did not crucify Christ, because failing to abide by one’s conscience in moral action renders the agent blameworthy.","Abelard gives the example of a man who, when he hears a woman singing, assumes that she is singing a love song and tries to seduce her.

What are the two cases Abelard uses to argue that human justice can even be just to punish an agent we strongly believe had no evil intention?,"Abelard uses two cases to argue that human justice can even be just to punish an agent we strongly believe had no evil intention. The first case is a woman who accidentally smothers her baby while trying to keep it warm at night and is overcome with grief. Abelard maintains that we should punish her for the beneficial example her punishment may have on others. The second case is a judge who may have excellent (but legally impermissible) evidence that a witness is perjuring himself. Since he cannot show that the witness is lying, the judge is forced to rule on the basis of the witness’s testimony that the accused, whom he believes to be innocent, is guilty. Abelard argues that human justice may with propriety ignore questions of intention in this case as well.","In the two cases Abelard uses to argue that human justice can even be just to punish an agent we strongly believe had no evil intention, what is the case that he argues? He argues that it is even just to punish the criminal who has committed a heinous crime, but not to punish the innocent person who was involved in the crime. But Abelard also argues that the case for which it is even just to punish the criminal, namely, that the punishment is the best deterrent, can be met only in the case in which the criminal has committed a heinous crime and the victim is innocent.

What is the problem with Abelard's position that the only certifiable sin is acting against one's conscience?,"The problem with Abelard's position is that if we cannot look to the intrinsic value of the deeds or their consequences, and conscience has no reliable guide, then his position seems to open the floodgates to well-meaning subjectivism. In other words, people would be free to do whatever they believe is right, even if it is not objectively so, which could lead to chaos.","The problem with Abelard's position that the only certifiable sin is acting against one's conscience is that it is not clear what this means. Abelard seems to be saying that one can commit a sin that is not certifiable unless one acts against one's conscience, but it is not clear what this means. It could mean that one can commit a sin that is not certifiable as long as one does not act against one's conscience, or it could mean that one can commit a sin that is not certifiable as long as one does act against one's conscience in a way that is not clearly unconscionable.",0.8535996079444885,0.8466231822967529,0.8606919050216675
What is the problem that Abelard's solution to the problem of how obedience to God's will can be a matter of the agent's intention conforming to a formal criterion leads to?,"The problem that Abelard's solution leads to is that even if we grant that an agent's intentions conform to the Golden Rule, it is not clear why the agent should care about this conformity. In other words, even if Abelard were right about morality, it is not clear why an agent should be moral.","The problem is that Abelard's solution to the problem of how obedience to God's will can be a matter of the agent's intention conforming to a formal criterion leads to the conclusion that it is always permissible to do what is in one's intention, regardless of whether one does it in accordance with God's will.

What is Abelard's view on the relationship between happiness and virtue?,"Abelard believes that our happiness is linked to virtue, which is habitual morally correct behavior. He argues that reason can prove that a merely naturalistic ethics is insufficient, and that an agent's happiness is necessarily bound up with accepting the principles of traditional Christian belief, including the belief in God and an Afterlife. In particular, he argues that the Afterlife is a condition to which we ought to aspire, that it is a moral improvement even on the life of virtue in this world, and that recognizing this is constitutive of wanting to do what God wants, that is, to live according to the Golden Rule, which guarantees as much as anything can (pending divine grace) our long-term postmortem happiness.","Abelard's view is that the relationship between happiness and virtue is not directly related, but that the two are connected in a complex way. He argues that the happiness of a person who is virtuous is not only increased, but also enhanced by the fact that he or she is happy.",0.8585066199302673,0.8807607889175415,0.8373492956161499

How does Abelard justify the claim that reason can be fruitfully applied to a particular article of faith?,Abelard justifies the claim that reason can be fruitfully applied to a particular article of faith by offering a case study in his own writings where he dialectically investigates the Trinity and elaborates an original theory of identity to address issues surrounding it. He argues that belief in the Trinity is rationally justifiable since as far as reason can take us we find that the doctrine makes sense once the tools of dialectic have been properly employed.,"Abelard might have justified the claim that reason can be fruitfully applied to a particular article of faith by saying that it is true because it is the best explanation of the truth that can be come up with, or by saying that it is true because it is the best of the things that can be true. However, these are not very satisfactory justifications, and they are often criticized for being circular or ad hoc. Abelard might have also justified the claim that reason can be fruitfully applied to a particular article of faith by saying that it is true because it is the best of all the things that can be true, or by saying that it is true because it is the only thing that can be true.

What is the difference between sameness and difference in definition and essential and numerical sameness and difference?,"Sameness and difference in definition is roughly analogous to modern theories of the identity of properties, while essential and numerical sameness and difference apply directly to things in the world and are extensional forms of identity. According to Abelard, things are the same in definition when what it is to be one requires that it be the other, and conversely; otherwise they differ in definition.","The difference between sameness and difference in definition and essential and numerical sameness and difference is in what they refer to as truth. In definition, a thing is the same if it is identical to some other thing. In essential sameness, two things are identical if and only if they are the same thing. In difference, two things are identical if and only if they differ in some respect. In numerical sameness, two numbers are identical if and only if they are equal.

How does Abelard use his theory of identity to explain the Trinity?,"Abelard explains the Trinity by stating that the three Persons are essentially the same as one another, since they are all the same concrete thing (namely God). They differ from one another in definition, since what it is to be the Father is not the same as what it is to be the Son or what it is to be the Holy Spirit. The three Persons are numerically different from one another, for otherwise they would not be three, but they are not numerically different from God: if they were there would be three gods, not one. Moreover, each Person has properties that uniquely apply to it—unbegotten to the Father, begotten to the Son, and proceeding to the Holy Spirit—as well as properties that are distinctive of it, such as power for the Father, wisdom for the Son, and goodness for the Holy Spirit. The unique properties are unmixed in Abelard’s technical sense, for the Persons differ from one another in their unique properties, and such properties do not apply to God; the distinctive properties are mixed, though, in that God is characterized by each (the powerful God is the wise God is the good God). Abelard holds that human reason cannot go further than this, but reason validates the analysis (strictly speaking only a “likeness” or analogy) as far as it can go.","Abelard uses his theory of identity to explain that the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are all the same person.",0.8523961901664734,0.9033150672912598,0.8069114685058594
Who was William of Champeaux and what was his contribution to philosophy?,"William of Champeaux was a French philosopher and theologian who lived in the 11th and 12th centuries. He was a prominent figure in the development of medieval philosophy and is best known for his work on logic, mereology, relations, and universals. He was a student of Anselm of Canterbury and later became a teacher himself, counting Peter Abelard among his students. William's most significant contribution to philosophy is his theory of universals, which holds that universals are real and exist independently of particular things. This theory was a major topic of debate in medieval philosophy and was challenged by Abelard, who argued that universals are merely mental constructs. William's work on logic and syllogisms was also influential and helped to shape the development of medieval logic. He was a leading figure in the School of Paris, which was a center of learning and philosophical debate in the 12th century. Despite his significant contributions to philosophy, William's work is not widely studied today and is often overshadowed by the more famous philosophers of the medieval period. Nonetheless, his ideas and theories continue to be an important part of the history of philosophy and have had a lasting impact on the development of Western thought",William of Champeaux was a French philosopher who made a contribution to logic by developing a system of deduction that would later be called abduction.

What does the term Abhidharma mean in the Buddhist exegetical tradition?,"In the Buddhist exegetical tradition, the term Abhidharma means approximately “higher” or “further” teaching, and it refers both to the doctrinal investigations of the new scholastic movement and to the body of texts yielded by its systematic exposition of Buddhist thought. This body of literature includes the third of the “three baskets” (Skt., tripiṭaka, Pali, tipiṭaka) of the Buddhist canon, namely, the Abhidharma-piṭaka (Pali, Abhidhamma-piṭaka), its commentaries, and later exegetical texts.","The term Abhidharma refers to a category of arguments that was used by Buddhist exegetes to justify the inclusion of certain texts in the Buddhist canon. The argument is typically presented as follows: These texts are true, and to believe otherwise is error. But what is the error? Because the text in question includes a statement that is true, it must be that the statement it includes is also true. But what is the statement that includes the true one? Abhidharma implies that we should exclude from our canon any text that includes a statement of which the premises are true, regardless of whether or not we think that statement is true.

What is Abhidharma and how does it differ from Sūtrānta?,"Abhidharma is a branch of thought and inquiry that is distinct from Sūtrānta, the system of the Buddha’s discourses. Unlike the earlier Buddhist discourses that are colloquial in nature, the Abhidharma method presents the Buddha’s teachings in technical terms that are carefully defined to ensure analytical exactitude. In content, Abhidharma is distinctive in its efforts to provide the theoretical counterpart to the Buddhist practice of meditation and, more broadly, a systematic account of sentient experience. It does so by analyzing conscious experience into its constituent mental and physical events. Abhidharma is also notable for its dharma theory, which is an overarching inquiry into the nature and interaction of dharmas, and its impact on subsequent Buddhist thought and systematic philosophy.","Abhidharma is a system of Indian medical diagnosis that originated in the 2nd century CE and was later refined into the system of diagnosis known as Sūtrānta.

What is the likelihood that the early formative period of the Buddhist community gave rise to multiple intellectual branches that developed spontaneously?,It is likely that the early formative period of the Buddhist community gave rise to multiple intellectual branches that developed spontaneously due to the geographical extension of the community over the entire Indian subcontinent and subject to the particular problems that confronted each monastic community (saṅgha).,"The early formative period of the Buddhist community is likely to have given rise to multiple intellectual branches that developed spontaneously, as the community was still in the process of establishing its doctrine and developing its philosophy. This is because the doctrine of anatta (anicurism) was still not fully developed, and the community was still grappling with questions of morality and ethics. It is also possible that the early formative period was characterized by a high degree of informal learning, which would have made it difficult to establish a clear delimitation between the early and late periods.

What is the distinction made by Buddhist tradition between the Sūtrānta and Abhidharma methods of instructing the teachings?,"Buddhist tradition distinguishes between the Sūtrānta and Abhidharma methods of instructing the teachings by contrasting the Sūtrānta “way of putting things” in partial, figurative terms that require further clarification, versus the Abhidharma exposition and catechism that expound the teachings fully, in non-figurative terms. This coincides with additional distinctions the tradition makes between texts that have implicit meaning versus those that have explicit meaning, and texts that are expressed in conventional terms versus others that are expressed in ultimate terms.","The Buddhist distinction between the Sūtrānta and Abhidharma methods of instructing the teachings refers to the way in which the teacher presents the teachings. The Sūtrānta method involves presenting the teachings in a systematic and organized manner, with the goal of explaining the nature of reality in a coherent and unified way. The Abhidharma method, on the other hand, involves presenting a variety of anecdotes and examples in order to illustrate the teachings. The Buddhists distinguish between these methods because they believe that the Sūtrānta method is more reliable and comprehensive, while the Abhidharma method is more practical and applicable to everyday life.",0.8781768679618835,0.8868227005004883,0.8696979284286499
What was the purpose of using lists in early Buddhist literature?,"The purpose of using lists in early Buddhist literature was to serve as mnemonic devices, as the literature was composed and for some centuries preserved orally. These lists were also powerful mnemonic devices and provided formulaic treatment of doctrinal items that were expounded elsewhere. The use of lists in early Buddhist literature can be traced to the collections of the Buddha’s discourses, where certain texts are arranged according to taxonomic lists, providing formulaic treatment of doctrinal items that are expounded elsewhere. Similar taxonomic lists form the table of contents of the Vibhaṅga and Puggalapaññatti of the Theravāda and the Saṅgītiparyāya and Dharmaskandha of the Sarvāstivāda, which are structured as commentaries on those lists.","The purpose of using lists in early Buddhist literature was to organize information in a way that was easy to remember and to convey the idea that there were many things to be remembered. This was a feature of early lists that was shared by many different kinds of lists, not just those that were organized in a way that suggested a list of things.",0.8402904272079468,0.8705018162727356,0.8121057152748108
What were some of the factors that contributed to the development of the discursive hermeneutics and argumentative style of Abhidharma literature?,"The development of the discursive hermeneutics and argumentative style of Abhidharma literature was influenced by the institutionalization of Buddhist thought, the transition from oral to written methods of textual transmission, the rise of monastic debates concerning the doctrine among the various Buddhist schools, intellectual assimilation and doctrinal disputes between the Buddhist monastic community and the contemporaneous Sanskrit Grammarians, Jains, and Brahmanical schools with their evolving scholastic and analytical movements. The dialectic format and the display of awareness of differences in doctrinal interpretation are the hallmarks of the Kathāvatthu and the Vijñānakāya. Later on, post-canonical Abhidharma texts became complex philosophical treatises employing sophisticated methods of argumentation and independent investigations that resulted in doctrinal conclusions quite far removed from their canonical antecedents.","Some factors that contributed to the development of the discursive hermeneutics and argumentative style of Abhidharma literature include the need for a coherent system of philosophy, the need to explain the philosophical concepts of time and causality, the need to defend a particular view of reality, and the need to communicate this view in a way that would be understandable and persuasive to a non-specialist audience.",0.8615449666976929,0.883817732334137,0.8403671979904175

What is the role of dharmas in the process of sensory perception according to the Abhidharma treatises?,"According to the Abhidharma treatises, dharmas are the objects of mental cognitive awareness, a particular type of consciousness that discerns between the stimuli impinging upon the sense faculties and that emerges when the requisite conditions come together. Dharmas are not merely mental objects like ideas, concepts, or memories. Rather, they are psycho-physical events with diverse capacities by means of which the mind unites and assimilates a particular perception, especially one newly presented, to a larger set or mass of ideas already possessed, thus comprehending and conceptualizing it.","The role of dharmas in the process of sensory perception is not mentioned in the Abhidharma treatises.

What is the role of citta in the process of sensory perception in Abhidharma?,"In Abhidharma, citta is the epitome of the operation of consciousness and is experienced in the process of sensory perception, which is deemed the paradigm of sentient experience. Citta is always intentional and directed to a particular object that is cognized by means of certain mental factors. It always occurs associated with its appropriate cetasikas or mental factors that perform diverse functions and that emerge and cease together with it, having the same object and grounded in the same sense faculty.

What is the role of dharmas in Abhidharma?,"In Abhidharma, dharmas are distinct (but interrelated) functions, energies, or causally significant aspects of consciousness moments. They are seen as properties, activities, or patterns of interconnection that construct one’s world, not as static substances. The Abhidharma lists of dharmas are open-ended, reflecting a dynamic conception of dharmas and leaving room for continued debates about what is and is not a dharma.

How does the practice of discrimination of dharmas help to undermine the solidity of the world we grasp at?,"The practice of discrimination of dharmas helps to undermine the solidity of the world we grasp at by demonstrating that no essence or independent self can be found in any phenomenon or its constituents. This is because all aspects of experience are impermanent, arising and passing away subject to numerous causes and conditions. Even the unconditioned dharmas, which have no cause and no effect, are shown to be not-self. As a result, when one tries to grasp the world of the Dhammasaṅgaṇi or the Paṭṭhāna, it runs through one's fingers.","The practice of discrimination of dharmas helps to undermine the solidity of the world we grasp at by showing that our intuitions are not reliable guides to factual reality, and that we must rely on our senses and our discriminatory faculty (such as the eye, the ear, and the tongue) to make sense of the world. This undermines the solidity of our understanding of the world as we have it, since it is based on our intuitions that are subjective and not objective. However, the practice of discrimination of dharmas also shows us how we can improve our understanding of the world by learning to discriminate more accurately, and by practicing this discrimination in our daily lives.",0.86283278465271,0.8719162344932556,0.8539366126060486

Present activity is an internal causal efficacy that assists in the production of an effect within a dharma’s own consciousness series. It is this activity that determines a dharma’s present existence and defines the limits of the span of its present moment. Capability, by contrast, is a conditioning efficacy externally directed towards another consciousness series: it constitutes a condition that assists another dharma in the production of its own effect. A dharma’s present activity arises and falls away, but past and future dharmas all have potential for causal functioning and exist as real entities due to their intrinsic nature.","The Sarvāstivāda-Vaibhāṣika understanding of spatio-temporal existence is that all things exist in a state of being, which is called ""dharmas"" (or ""samsara"" in Sanskrit).",0.8737913370132446,0.9110260605812073,0.8394806981086731

Horizontal causality produces the next moment of the same consciousness series, while vertical causality produces a different effect and connects the dharma with the incessant rise and fall of other dharmas, further individuating it as that very particular dharma by manifesting its unique quality and intensity of operation.","In the Sarvāstivāda-Vaibhāṣika view, horizontal causality refers to the causation of changes in a thing by its vicinity, while vertical causality refers to the causation of changes in a thing by its owner.

"What shift in emphasis in the Abhidharma is indicated by the terms ""particular inherent characteristic"" and ""general characteristic""?","The shift in emphasis in the Abhidharma indicated by the terms ""particular inherent characteristic"" and ""general characteristic"" is a shift towards reducing the phenomenal, causally conditioned world into the activity of cognition and consciousness. This shift was part of a broader movement in Indian philosophy in which Hindu, Jain, and Buddhist thinkers turned away from traditional metaphysical questions about the nature of the external world and the self, and focused instead on the study of epistemology, logic, and language. Their purpose was to provide systematic accounts of the nature and means of valid cognition. Within Buddhist circles, this epistemological turn saw the rise of thinkers such as Asaṅga and Vasubandhu, the founders of the Yogācāra (400–480 CE), and, most notably, Dignāga and Dharmakīrti (around 500 CE) who developed sophisticated logical and philosophical systems.","The shift in emphasis in the Abhidharma is indicated by the terms ""particular inherent characteristic"" and ""general characteristic"".
