Additionally, because the evidence available is often incomplete and variable, it is difficult to determine how much weight to give to each of these properties in turn, or to determine which of them are most essential to the truth of the matter in question.

      "Mediaeval philosophers use to explain how a concept is about an object to mean that it is a function of its subject by means of its predicate “to be an object of” (in the sense of “to be a thing that is a part of something else other than itself’) in a particular way, that is, by means of a function that is both independent of its subject and in some way analogous to it in its properties. And this explanation is based on the fact that the concept of an object in its simplest form (which includes its name, its number of parts, and its relation to other concepts) is in fact a function of its subject in this way, since to be a part of something else other than itself and having the same property as that concept requires the same means as that concept.</|im_end|>\n",

The resemblance theory, on the other hand, assumes that perceptual features are causally related in a way that is local, non-invasive, and independent of any intervening mental actions but that they also have non-local, causal, and non-invasive relations with their corresponding actions.\n",

This representation can be understood as a function of its formal part by virtue of its being a function of its means, which is a function of its mind, and by virtue of its material part by virtue of its being a function of its sensory information, which is also a function of its mind.<|im_end|>\n",

However, the Buddha also teaches that this perceptual consciousness is subject to the conditions of suffering and the arising of duality. According to the Abhidhamma, this perceptual consciousness is composed of five factors or modes of existence: perceptual awareness or anāvāya, bodily sensations or cārvākaśāstra, mental objects or Abhāsāvīgaśāstra, cause or māyāvīgaśāstra,\n",
